Rooftop solar power plant (RTPV) is one of the good solar power generation technique. In this paper, a brief description on design, commissioning and techno economic analysis of a 50Kwp rooftop solar power plant design in Uluberia super specialty hospital Howrah, India have been described. The electricity generation in both input DC and output AC end of each inverter is recorded and monitored and analyzed in this paper. The input end DC power of the inverter is coming from solar panels. The open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Isc), maximum power (Mp) is noted as 48\\xc2\\xa0V, 50\\xc2\\xa0A, 49\\xc2\\xa0KW, respectively, during 11am to 2\\xc2\\xa0pm which is the bright sunny time of the day in West Bengal. The output power of the inverter is connected with the main transmission grid. The grid connectivity rule of solar power plant with main grid of West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (WBSEDCL) is briefly mentioned. The generated current, voltage, power by solar panels of the RTPV power plant is taken out using a remote data logger to a dedicated cloud server and analyzed the output data in this paper. The total load of the hospital building is 450\\xc2\\xa0kva, which was paid earlier to WBSEDCL. The plant is generating an average of 5000 units per month, saving Rs. 511,817 per year. The Capacitive Utilization Factor (CUF) of this solar power plant is 14.7%.

Through theoretical analysis, we find that the reduction effect of carbon tax on carbon emissions is amplified by commercial banks via financing more green investments. Moreover, such effect is altered by commercial banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 capability to issue green loans.

This strategy hinges on measurements of salt marsh carbon accumulation rates, which vary widely creating uncertainty in monetizing carbon credits. Here, we show the 14\\xe2\\x80\\x93323 g C m\\xe2\\x88\\x922 yr\\xe2\\x88\\x921 range of carbon accumulation rates, derived from cores collected at seven sites in North Carolina U.S.A., results from the landward or basinward trajectory of salt marsh colonization and the intertidal space available for accretion. Rates increase with accelerating sea-level rise and are highest at young and expanding marsh edges. The highest carbon densities are near the upland, highlighting the importance of this area for building a rich stock of carbon that would be prevented by upland development. Explaining variability in carbon accumulation rates clarifies appraisal of salt marsh restoration projects and landscape conversion, in terms of mitigating green-house gas emissions. \\xc2\\xa9 2022, The Author(s).\"\\n\"Ding D., Jiang D., Zhou Y., Xia F., Chen Y., Kong L., Wei J., Zhang S., Deng S.\",\"Assessing the environmental impacts and costs of biochar and monitored natural attenuation for groundwater heavily contaminated with volatile organic compounds\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134695373&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.157316&partnerID=40&md5=adcb4efa5d7985f4cc22db0bff096119\",\"Although biochar (BC) and monitored natural attenuation (MNA) are regarded as green technologies for remediating volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contaminated groundwater, their life cycle environmental impacts and costs have not been systematically quantified. This work assessed the primary and secondary environmental impacts and the cost of three options for remediating the groundwater at a closed pesticide manufacturing plant site, which was contaminated by high levels of multiple VOCs and is undergoing MNA. The studied options include a combination of MNA and BC (MNA + BC), BC, and pump and treat (PT). The environmental impacts were examined through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) using the ReCiPe 2016 method. The costs were evaluated using a Life Cycle Cost (LCC) method created in the SimaPro. The LCA results show that the overall environmental impacts follow the sequence of PT &gt; BC &gt; MNA + BC, but MNA + BC shows evident primary impacts. The CO2 eq emissions generated from PT are more than five times of MNA + BC or BC. The cement, electricity, and steel for construction, and the operation energy are the environmental hotspots in PT. In MNA + BC and BC, the electricity for feedstock pyrolysis is the environmental hotspot, while the use of BC by-products to generate heat and power has positive environmental credit that compensates other negative environmental burdens. Incorporating institutional controls, using renewable energy and recycled or alternative materials, and developing BC with superior adsorption capacity are recommended to optimize the remediation strategies. The LCC results show that PT renders the highest cost, with cement and electricity being the two most expensive items. Electricity is the dominant contributor to the costs of MNA + BC and BC, while the avoided heat and power generation can save the cost of other items. Overall, this study provides scientific support to develop and optimize green remediation solutions for VOCs contaminated groundwater. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 Elsevier B.V.\"\\n\"Simionescu M., Strielkowski W., Gavurova B.\",\"Could quality of governance influence pollution?

Adopting the panel data of 36 sectors in China, this study employs the difference-in-differences method to estimate the effect of green credit policy on total factor energy efficiency and explore its corresponding influencing mechanisms. The main findings are as follows. First, the implementation of China\\'s Green Credit Guidelines 2012 (GCG2012) could significantly improve total factor energy efficiency by 1.21 % in \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctwo high and one surplus\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sectors. Second, the positive effect of GCG2012 is different among sectors, and it is more significant in sectors with an energy-saving target, less percentage of state-owned enterprises, and a higher degree of trade openness. Third, GCG2012 could affect energy efficiency through three mechanisms: research and development investment, energy mix, and financing constraints. It is recommended to strengthen the coordination between the green credit policy and other policies, such as climate-energy and sci-technology policies. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 Elsevier Inc.\"\\n\"Kong G., Wang S., Wang Y.\",\"Fostering firm productivity through green finance: Evidence from a quasi-natural experiment in China\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135895673&doi=10.1016%2fj.econmod.2022.105979&partnerID=40&md5=a01cf2cff01bb391a429f9e9343bcdf1\",\"This study investigated how green finance affects the total factor productivity (TFP) of firms in heavily polluting industries.

We are likely willing to pay an extra price for that quality. Ammonia (NH3) synthesis accounts for 2 % of global energy production and is an important point of attention for the development of green energy technologies. Therefore, we propose a thermally integrated process for H2 production and NH3 synthesis using plasma technology, and we evaluate its techno-economic performance and CO2 footprint by life cycle assessment (LCA). The key is to integrate energy-wise a high-temperature plasma (HTP) process, with a (low-temperature) non-thermal plasma (NTP) process and to envision their joint economic potential. This particularly means raising the temperature of the NTP process, which is typically below 100 \\xc2\\xb0C, taking advantage of the heat released from the HTP process. For that purpose, we proposed the integrated process and conducted chemical kinetics simulations in the NTP section to determine the thermodynamically feasible operating window of this novel combined plasma process. The results suggest that an NH3 yield of 2.2 mol% can be attained at 302 \\xc2\\xb0C at an energy yield of 1.1 g NH3/kWh. Cost calculations show that the economic performance is far from commercial, mainly because of the too low energy yield of the NTP process. However, when we base our costs on the best literature value and plausible future scenarios for the NTP energy yield, we reach a cost prediction below 452 $/tonne NH3, which is competitive with conventional small-scale Haber-Bosch NH3 synthesis for distributed production. In addition, we demonstrate that biogas can be used as feed, thus allowing the proposed integrated reactor concept to be part of a biogas-to-ammonia circular concept. Moreover, by LCA we demonstrate the environmental benefits of the proposed plant, which could cut by half the carbon emissions when supplied by photovoltaic electricity, and even invert the carbon balance when supplied by wind power due to the avoided emissions of the carbon black credits. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 The Authors\"\\n\"Zhou J., Chen Q., Qi P., Liu Z.\",\"Study on the supply and demand matching for policies related to the coordinated development of high haze industries such as thermal power industry and economy in the Beijing\\xe2\\x80\\x93Tianjin\\xe2\\x80\\x93Hebei region\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132335890&doi=10.1016%2fj.egyr.2022.05.061&partnerID=40&md5=f29506b01862b1169b1d3db1c6c68cce\",\"In recent years, with the rapid development of China\\'s economy, high haze industries such as thermal power industry in the Beijing\\xe2\\x80\\x93Tianjin\\xe2\\x80\\x93Hebei region have been over concentrated, and the environmental pollution is becoming more and more serious.

These certificates are different from the widely investigated green or environmental-related certificates. Employing transaction data for detached houses in the Tokyo metropolitan area, hedonic regression analyses reveal the following relationships between certificates and transaction prices. First, long-life quality houses designed to last longer than ordinary houses result in a positive premium on transaction prices. Second, the mortgage tax credit-related certificates for transactions of existing houses, such as those meeting earthquake resilience standards or defect insurance inspection standards, result in a positive premium on transaction prices, especially for older properties. Third, the economical premiums from other certificates may be neutral if benefits for buyers are limited or the certificate has a complementary relationship with another. Considering that the positive premium of certificates means that buyers highly demand such properties, our results imply that the promotion of long-life property and existing housing transactions through financial incentives is shifting the nature of active new construction and rapid demolition of properties to a more sustainable society with longer economic life of building. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Abbas H.W., Guo X., Anwar B., Naqvi S.A.A., Shah S.A.R.\",\"The land degradation neutrality management enablers, challenges, and benefits for mobilizing private investments in Pakistan\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131945542&doi=10.1016%2fj.landusepol.2022.106224&partnerID=40&md5=3355300f3c7f23fca69adb8c3c5e1fdc\",\"Limited investments in land degradation neutrality (LDN) are causing environmental degradation and are the main barriers to socioeconomic development worldwide. Therefore, it is crucial to meet the target 15.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals to achieve soil neutrality by 2030 at the national level. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to find critical enablers, challenges, and benefits of LDN and develop a new administrative management framework for mobilizing private investments according to local financial market conditions. To achieve this research objective, the authors selected 14 degraded districts in four provinces of Pakistan. The data for this study were collected from 63 institutions that were directly or indirectly involved in land degradation risk prevention and management. The research evaluation process comprises a mixed-method approach to infer institutional survey data analysis. The interpretation of the results was based on two important dimensions, including 12 survey statements. From the perspective of LDN management (LDNM) enablers, the government\\'s long-term vision and strong commitment were validated as top-ranked measures among the six enablers for the implementation of LDN. The development of horizontal and vertical coordination mechanisms for the LDN is the second-most critical enabler. While developing public-private partnership (PPP) policies, procedures and services are perceived as the third most potent enabler. In terms of LDNM challenges and benefits, raising awareness of the LDN concept, capacity development, and LDN market risk assessment are identified as the main challenges. However, developing a green economy, securing social needs, and ensuring ecological sustainability are vital benefits. This study makes theoretical and practical contributions to the field of LDNM. Theoretically, this study contributes to the LDNM framework based on complexity theory by integrating transaction cost logic to execute win-win PPP agreements. Practically, to meet different market conditions, this study suggests three PPP models: special credit lines, risk-sharing facilities, and land protection performance contracts. These inputs will provide insight into what the government needs to develop for land use policy, promote LDN investments, and forge new partnerships between local financial institutions and landscape stakeholders. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Hu J., Wang K.-H., Su C.W., Umar M.\",\"Oil price, green innovation and institutional pressure: A China\\'s perspective\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131460078&doi=10.1016%2fj.resourpol.2022.102788&partnerID=40&md5=350139abdfdc48e2be0bc0d7633aa7ce\",\"Oil is of dominated role in global energy market, and its price volatility would bring significant economic and environmental consequents. Given China is the largest oil importer, this paper applies the mixed frequency vector autoregression (MF-VAR) to investigate the causal relationship among oil price (OP), green innovation (GI), and institutional pressure (IP). The empirical results from MF-VAR model show that quarterly OP would stimulate GI with time-varying, which is not found in low frequency vector autoregression (LF-VAR). The new evidence mainly due to the mix frequency technique, which allows heterogeneous impacts exist between high and low frequency variables. In addition, higher IP is also discovered to promote GI. The major contribution is that a theoretical framework is initially constructed, and oil price is proven to as important booster for China\\'s green innovation. Therefore, some policies such as innovation subsidy and green credit need to be employed to reduce the impacts from oil price fluctuations and main sustainable GI capability. Meanwhile, IP mainly from environmental protection requires government to launch stricter environmental regulations and laws, and establish reward and punishment mechanism to promote GI. \\xc2\\xa9 2022\"\\n\"Shao H., Wang Y., Wang Y., Li Y.\",\"Green credit policy and stock price crash risk of heavily polluting enterprises: Evidence from China\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131445439&doi=10.1016%2fj.eap.2022.05.007&partnerID=40&md5=0c71d10a3b115068553df37d8fb7f7b8\",\"This study investigates how green credit guidelines (GCG) influence the stock price crash risk of heavily polluting enterprises by taking the implementation of GCG as a quasi-natural experiment.

Two policy scenarios are empirically evaluated, taking into account the behaviour of financial intermediaries with limited financial resources for credit supply to the productive sectors. Policy Scenario I, a credit allocation system that places a greater emphasis on financing demands of government and state-owned enterprises (GSEs), has a positive (increasing) effect on CO2gdp. The alternative policy scenario, Policy Scenario II, which places a greater emphasis on financing demands of private sector entities (PSUs), has a negative (decreasing) effect on CO2gdp with stronger impact in the more carbon-intensive economies. In addition, renewable energy consumption makes greater contribution to reducing CO2gdp under Policy Scenario II. By implication, more credit supply to the PSUs strengthens the link between resource allocation and economic efficiency, resulting in the creation of greener economic output.

Through further analysis, we found that state-owned enterprises (SOE) are more affected by green credit policy than non-state-owned enterprises (NSOE), and companies in regions with a lower green development index are more affected by green credit policy than companies in higher green developing regions. Although China\\'s green credit policy has a certain inhibitory effect on the illiquid debts financing behavior of heavily-polluting enterprises, it has failed to allocate the capital flow effectively due to the firm-level alternative financing response to the green credit policy. From the managerial significance of the policy, the signal guidance of green finance needs to be strengthened for enterprises. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Xu G., Lu N., Tong Y.\",\"Greenwashing and credit spread: Evidence from the Chinese green bond market\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131036733&doi=10.1016%2fj.frl.2022.102927&partnerID=40&md5=6848bdecdc25f34b4014693522a4c54d\",\"This study analyzes how greenwashing affects green bond (GB) pricing.

In the past, researchers examined the relationship between financial growth and carbon emissions, and very limited studies examined the role of green finance in carbon extenuation. Based on these four indicators, which are sustainable credit, sustainable safety, sustainable insurance, and sustainable asset, a green finance index was developed in this study. In this study, a vector error correction model (VECM) is used to examine associations between the growth level of green finance, public spending, and the zero-carbon mechanism using data from 2005 to 2018. The results of this study indicate that China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s green finance industry had grown quickly, with enhancements in green finance and increased public spending, all contributing to reducing the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s environmental degradation. The simultaneous increase in carbon intensity slowed the expansion of non-fossil energy usage, reduced the flow of investing in green projects, and finally deteriorated the development of green finance. Furthermore, renewable energy usage in China is chiefly influenced by carbon intensity and green finance, both of which had clear policy-driven consequences. The effects of green finance strategies have consistently fallen short of expectations and lacked consistency. This study makes recommendations for improving the effectiveness of green finance policy implementation and increasing renewable energy to reduce or erode the economic gains of the zero-carbon mechanism.

The travel and tourism sector is a central contributor to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employment, foreign exchange earnings, and the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic diversification strategy. However, the rapid growth of the sector and increase in international tourist arrivals are also major contributors to carbon emissions and long-term environmental challenges. In this context, we employed a tourism-induced Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) model for the UAE from 1984 to 2019. The study applied an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to determine the marginal impact of tourist arrivals and related variables, namely, bank credits to the private sector, urbanization, and energy use, on CO2 emissions. The Pesaran bounds test indicated redundancy of short run estimates. The long-run coefficients confirmed the EKC hypothesis of inverted U-shape for carbon emissions and per capita income, along with environmental degradation due to tourist arrivals and financial development. Notably, urbanization and energy use highlighted the positive steps taken by the government. Granger causality tests indicated a unidirectional association from GDP, bank credits, and energy consumption to carbon emissions. Importantly, tourist arrivals and urbanization had bidirectional causality with carbon dioxide levels. This study is the first to apply the tourism-induced EKC model to the UAE, and the findings have important implications for policymakers and practitioners. The causality results highlight the need to balance tourism targets and sustainable economic growth through the adoption of \\xe2\\x80\\x98green\\xe2\\x80\\x99 standards.

Considering the introduction of the China Green Credit Guidelines in 2012 as an exogenous shock, the positive effect of carbon risk on the cost of bank loans for a firm is more significant. In the cross-section, the positive effect is more pronounced for firms with low environmental performance, firms with low green innovation, firms in high-carbon industries, and non-state-owned enterprises. Furthermore, we document that a firm\\'s profitability and earnings volatility are two underlying channels through which carbon risk affects the cost of bank loans. These findings are robust to addressing endogeneity concerns with the use of propensity score matching and instrumental variables methods, to alternative model specifications and proxies for carbon risk. \\xc2\\xa9 2022\"\\n\"Wu F., Li P., Dong X., Lu Y.\",\"Exploring the effectiveness of China\\'s dual credit policy in a differentiated automobile market when some consumers are environmentally aware\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130222263&doi=10.1016%2fj.eneco.2022.106077&partnerID=40&md5=96528fff857476f8072256be2bb68c7f\",\"This paper analyzes how China\\'s dual credit policy affects electric vehicle market penetration and energy efficiency improvement in a Hotelling\\'s linear city model, when there exists a proportion of green consumers who are environmentally aware.

Our result shows that the adoption of electric vehicles would be facilitated with the increasing number of green consumers and rising price of new energy vehicle credits. The fall of standard new energy vehicle credits might speed up electric vehicle adoption significantly if it helps eliminate the credit surplus and raise the credit price effectively. Surprisingly, the growth of new energy vehicle credit percentage requirement may not play an important role in promoting electric vehicles. Meanwhile, we find that fuel efficiency improvement of gasoline vehicles may be slightly hampered. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 Elsevier B.V.\"\\n\"Rugh M.B., Grant S.B., Hung W.-C., Jay J.A., Parker E.A., Feraud M., Li D., Avasarala S., Holden P.A., Liu H., Rippy M.A., Werfhorst L.C.V.D., Kefela T., Peng J., Shao S., Graham K.E., Boehm A.B., Choi S., Mohanty S.K., Cao Y.\",\"Highly variable removal of pathogens, antibiotic resistance genes, conventional fecal indicators and human-associated fecal source markers in a pilot-scale stormwater biofilter operated under realistic stormflow conditions\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129702646&doi=10.1016%2fj.watres.2022.118525&partnerID=40&md5=08ede9c8239800ed2dd98062155141c1\",\"Green stormwater infrastructure systems, such as biofilters, provide many water quality and other environmental benefits, but their ability to remove human pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from stormwater runoff is not well documented.

When challenged with a 50:50 mixture of untreated sewage and stormwater (to mimic highly contaminated storm flow) the biofilter significantly removed (p < 0.05) 14 of 17 microbial markers and ARGsin descending order of concentration reduction: ermB (2.5 log(base 10) reduction) > Salmonella (2.3) > adenovirus (1.9) > coliphage (1.5) > crAssphage (1.2) > E. coli (1.0) \\xe2\\x88\\xbc 16S rRNA genes (1.0) \\xe2\\x88\\xbc fecal coliform (1.0) \\xe2\\x88\\xbc intl1 (1.0) > Enterococcus (0.9) \\xe2\\x88\\xbc MRSA (0.9) \\xe2\\x88\\xbc sul1 (0.9) > PMMoV (0.7) > Entero1A (0.5).

Our study documents high variability (>100-fold) in the removal of different microbial contaminants and ARGs by a field-scale stormwater biofilter operated under transient flow and raises further questions about the utility of human-associated fecal source markers as surrogates for pathogen removal. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Sarkar S., Modak N.M., Giri B.C., Sarkar A.K., C\\xc3\\xa1rdenas-Barr\\xc3\\xb3n L.E.\",\"Coordinating a supplier\\xe2\\x80\\x93retailer JELS model considering product quality assessment and green retailing\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129035966&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.131658&partnerID=40&md5=8c0911126a7e3523cb0a7f592612944d\",\"Environmental awareness among the people is constantly increasing, which has resulted in massive pressure on companies from various stakeholders including the government and consumers to mitigate the detrimental effects on the environment. This work deals with a joint economic lot size (JELS) model to enhance the greening efforts of a product that flows along a two-level supply chain (supplier\\xe2\\x80\\x93retailer). Both selling price and greening effort level of the product influence the market demand. Here we assume that every individual lot shipped to the retailer carries some random defective items. Each lot received by the retailer goes through an error-free sub-lot sampled inspection process to remove the defective items. A fraction of faulty items are classified as usable and are sold at a salvage value and the rest items are disposed of. The retailer has to bear per item penalty cost for selling the uninspected defective items. We develop the profit function under three decision-making scenarios: centralized, decentralized, and coordinated. Coordination is made based on a trade-credit scheme under which the retailer changes his/her optimal decisions according to a centralized policy. We obtain a minimum and maximum credit period duration which encourages both the retailer and the supplier to follow the coordinated decision-making policy. The coordinated model suggests that more emphasis should be given to the greening effort level for higher profit. It is observed that, in many cases, a sub-lot inspection gives better results compared to a full lot inspection. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Haibo C., Manu E.K.\",\"The impact of banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 financial performance on environmental performance in Africa\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125356569&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-022-19401-w&partnerID=40&md5=f8ab9654b791a7d73570a74f8adcf53c\",\"To better understand Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s banks and the environment, this study investigates the impact of financial performance on environmental performance in Africa.

NH3 production is concentrated in a few countries, adding emissions due to global distribution. Distributed plants next to farmers and fed by renewable energy can reduce these impacts, as well as NH3 storage, shortage risks, and price volatility. Distributed plants cannot reach low NH3 production costs as centralised plants, but they can be promoted by the environmental benefits of its products lifecycles. Therefore, life cycle assessments of NH3 production pathways and specific modelling for NH3 transport in Australia were performed, from cradle-to-site, to identify the influence of storage, transport, and energy sources in their environmental profiles. The carbon footprint of centralised production was up to 2.96 kg.CO2-eq/kg.NH3, from which 29.3% corresponded to transport. Local production demonstrated substantial avoided transport impacts and that CO2-eq can reach reductions over 100% when including co-product credits such as oxygen and carbon black.

The findings revealed that, on average crossbred and local cow dairy farms maintained 1.60 and 1.25 milch animals, respectively. The investment percentage was found to be highest on milch animals followed by cattle shed and equipment for both the category of farm households which were \\xe2\\x82\\xb9 80756.82 for crossbred and \\xe2\\x82\\xb9 21506.75 for local cow, and the overall investment was \\xe2\\x82\\xb9 102263.57. On average milking crossbred cow was fed with 11.33 kg/day of dry fodder, 17.06 kg/day of green fodder, and 3.23 kg/day of concentrates, and for the local cow, it was 5.82 kg/day of dry fodder, 7.25 kg/day of green fodder, and 1.75 kg/day of concentrates, respectively. The average yield per crossbred cow was 9.50 liters/day, and that of the local cow was 1.60 liters/day. It can be concluded that training facilities by veterinary and extension workers on scientific knowledge and management techniques to the farmers for cattle farming should be encouraged. Improvements in cattle feeding patterns through green fodder cultivation are also encouraged, as farmers rely primarily on open grazing to feed their cattle\\'s. The government should also increase the availability of marketing and credit facilities, as the study area falls short in these areas. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 Economic Affairs (New Delhi).

Therefore, this paper explores the effect of green credit policy on firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 investment decisions. Using Chinese listed firms from 2008 to 2020, we found that the green credit policy tended to reduce pollutant-emitting firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 investment level but increases pollutant-emitting firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 investment efficiency; this effect was more pronounced in state-owned firms, firms with high-quality corporate governance, and those with a higher analyst following. This paper contributes to the literature on the economic consequences of the green credit policy and can help commercial banks and other financial institutions allocate green credits more effectively. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 by the authors.

We examine a transport infrastructure case in Medellin, Colombia, called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTunel del Oriente\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Eastern tunnel), which meets sustainable criteria to allow the access to credit through a sustainable bond. This study proposes a model to evaluate the right to exercise the conversion option by employing ROA with a binomial approach under the concept of a call option. The underlying assets are based on revenues from the forecast of estimated demand and the alternative sales of carbon credits as the sustainable factor. The results indicated that the financial captured value (FCV), with one as the conversion ratio, could be up to 39.10% of the investment when the lender decides to become a shareholder. Furthermore, the FCV can increase by 6% more if the project sells TonCO2e saved by the sustainable factor, highlighting that the tax benefits are approximately 11% of the FCV if the project is sustainable. Additionally, the option value is 39.09% of the debt amount. Finally, this study demonstrates that project finance using mezzanine debt proves to be an effective and attractive method for any lender wanting to boost profit while supporting stakeholders and the environment with sustainable projects and responsible investment. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 by the authors.

It was found that the policy promotes the quantity and quality of corporate green innovation. The mechanism test showed that policy promotes the R&D investment and expands the credit scale. The study further found that green finance policies enhance the green innovation of enterprises as government environmental regulation is strengthened. Finally, green innovation by state-owned enterprises is more strongly promoted in the pilot green finance reform and innovation zones, and green innovation by enterprises in non-polluting sectors is more sensitive to the policy, with a heterogeneous pattern of policy effects in eastern and non-eastern China. Therefore, green finance policies should be promoted to achieve an effective combination of financial resource allocation and corporate green innovation to promote the construction of ecological civilization. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 by the authors.

The present article measures the relationship between green credit and sustainable economic growth using a benchmark regression analysis model and explores the main influencing factors and regional characteristics that affect the coupling development of green credit and sustainable economic growth by combining mechanism and heterogeneity tests. The results of the study show that: (i) Green credit has a significant positive contribution to sustainable economic growth. (ii) In terms of the transmission mechanism, industrial upgrading and environmental regulation have a significant impact on sustainable economic growth. (iii) In terms of heterogeneity, the effect of green credit on sustainable economic growth is the most pronounced in the west, followed by the central and eastern regions of China. The policy implications of this study are that green credit in China is an inevitable trend, and that a sound policy supporting the legal system and information communication mechanisms should be promulgated to ensure the effective allocation of resources, thereby promoting the coordinated, sustainable and stable development of environmental protection and the economy. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 by the authors.

Green credit (GC), consisting of environmental regulation and economic leverage, has a profound impact on improving total factor carbon emission performance (TFCEP). By selecting the panel data of 30 provinces and municipalities in China from 2001 to 2020, this paper constructs a series of panel models to analyze the transmission path of GC to TFCEP. The results indicate that the relationship between GC and TFCEP showed an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinverted-U-shaped\\xe2\\x80\\x9d relationship. This is mainly because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cenergy-saving and emission reduction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d first appeared in the government planning outline in 2006, and transition-friendly enterprises successfully transformed with low-interest green credit, thereby effectively improving their TFCEP. However, as environmental regulations continue to increase and the scale of green credit continues to expand, the efficiency of green credit allocation and internal conflicts with other environmental regulation policies are also emerging. At the same time, the advancement of industrial structure and green technology innovation had a significant mediating effect between GC and TFCEP; government quality has a strong moderating effect on the second stage of the mediating process. When GC reaches a certain scale, it tends to restrain TFCEP more in central and western China than in eastern China. Therefore, it is of great significance to continuously increase the scale of GC, promote the advancement of clean energy industrial structure, and improve green technology innovation. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 by the authors.

Relative to low carbon risk issuers, high carbon risk issuers have substantially larger bond credit spreads, mainly because their credit risk is greater and they invest the funds in non-green projects. This positive relationship is more pronounced for issuers with financing constraints, those not making a green transition and those in cities with stringent environmental regulations. We find a reversed effect during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, China\\'s carbon peak and carbon neutral goals have renewed the focus on carbon risk. Carbon risk also causes bond issuers to scale back production and negatively affects their likelihood of receiving long-term financial support. Our findings suggest that investors consider carbon risk and charge a corresponding risk premium. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 Sun Yat-sen University\"\\n\"Nenavath S.\",\"Impact of fintech and green finance on environmental quality protection in India: By applying the semi-parametric difference-in-differences (SDID)\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130525362&doi=10.1016%2fj.renene.2022.05.020&partnerID=40&md5=878789ad956acf59645b44a46549c196\",\"This research study is one of the significant to offer an inclusive investigation of the impact of green finance correlated policies by applying text analysis approach and panel data from 28 states and 8 union territories between 2010 and 2020.

Promoting the development of green buildings (GBs) via the application of green financial instruments (GFIs, including green fiscal investment, green credit, green insurance, and green bonds) is crucial for China to achieve carbon mitigation goals. This study explores the effect and mechanism of GFIs on supporting the development of GBs using time series econometrics. Results show that the overall green finance system exhibits significant supporting effects on the development of GBs. Among four types of GFIs, green fiscal investment plays a critical and an indispensable role. The effects of alternative GFI combinations on GB development are compared. The combination of green fiscal investment, insurance, and credit shows the most satisfactory supporting effect. In this combination, insurance plays a bridging role, as it better ensures that GBs\\' actual energy performance meets expected performance, thus promoting green credit financing for GBs. However, the results also indicate that the current green finance market is still in a government-driven pattern. To facilitate its transformation to a market-driven pattern, policies should focus on designing more targeted GFI-combination products, bridging GBs\\' performance gaps, and updating GBs\\' rating system. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Jian G., Sarathi R.S., Burghardt J., Bonneville A., Gupta V., Fernandez C.A., Garrison G.\",\"Erratum to \\xe2\\x80\\x98Evaluation of a Greener Fracturing Fluid for Geothermal Energy Recovery: An Experimental and Simulation Study\\xe2\\x80\\x99 [Geothermics 97 (2021) 102266](S0375650521002236)(10.1016/j.geothermics.2021.102266)\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127154860&doi=10.1016%2fj.geothermics.2022.102383&partnerID=40&md5=1feec3b7077101b59182209fb7440b42\",\"Reason for Erratum: The original article has a typo \\xe2\\x80\\x9cx223C\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on several places that was generated during printing of the article.

This has become the external driving force behind the diversification of heavily polluting enterprises. Through a sample of listed Chinese companies from 2009 to 2015, this paper uses the implementation of the Green Credit Guidelines in 2012 as a quasi-natural experiment and constructs a difference-in-differences model. The empirical evidence shows that the implementation of this green credit policy significantly increased the tendency of heavily polluting enterprises to diversify, and this effect was more obvious among heavily polluting enterprises that are large in scale, have weak governance, are in regions with high marketization levels and whose operating units have already been involved in non-heavily polluting industries. Furthermore, this paper verifies the type and degree of the diversification of heavily polluting enterprises through logistic and Poisson regressions. The results indicate that heavily polluting enterprises tend to enter non-heavily polluting industries by means of business diversification and that this behaviour is not for speculative purposes but is rather an in-depth strategic investment. Therefore, green credit policies help propel the transformation and upgrading of heavily polluting industries. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland\"\\n\"Zhang D., Kong Q.\",\"Credit policy, uncertainty, and firm R&D investment: A quasi-natural experiment based on the Green Credit Guidelines\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126695039&doi=10.1016%2fj.pacfin.2022.101751&partnerID=40&md5=d177f161c8bd11661067f1cca76c4f19\",\"We investigate the impact of green credit policy on the R&D investment of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctwo high and one leftover\\xe2\\x80\\x9d enterprises using China\\'s 2012 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreen Credit Guidelines\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the difference-in-difference method.

Second, after implementing the GCGs, compared with THOS industry, the peer effect of green innovation in non-THOS industries is stronger. Green innovation in THOS enterprises could promote green innovation in non-THOS enterprises in the same peer group. Third, the stricter the financing constraint and the fiercer the industrial competition faced by enterprises, the weaker the peer effect of green innovation among industries. The higher the degree of marketization, the stronger the peer effect of green innovation for non-THOS enterprises. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Fabozzi F.J., Focardi S., Ponta L., Rivoire M., Mazza D.\",\"The economic theory of qualitative green growth\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125849318&doi=10.1016%2fj.strueco.2022.02.005&partnerID=40&md5=9c6b174afd362b6649d720b98b66d179\",\"Advanced economies are increasingly forced to act in order to mitigate climate changes and to reduce the impact of human activity on the environment.

The implementation of the green credit policy restricts loans to industries with high energy consumption, high pollution, and overcapacity to prevent excessive expansion and consumption of resources, thereby achieving the goals of industrial restructuring and environmental protection. Technological innovation is an important means to cope with environmental changes and adjust the industrial structure. Can technological innovation under green credit achieve the upgrading of the industrial structure? This paper combines green credit, technological innovation, and industrial structure upgrading to conduct research, and theoretically analyzes the impact of green credit and technological innovation on industrial structure upgrading, and analyzes how green credit affects industrial structure upgrading through technological innovation. An empirical test using panel data from 30 provinces in China from 2005 to 2017 revealed that green credit can promote the upgrading of the industrial structure. Econometric analysis based on the mediation effect model found that green credit not only directly promotes the upgrading of the industrial structure, but also has the mediation effect that affects the upgrading of the industrial structure through technological innovation. In the sub-regional regression analysis, technological innovation affects the upgrading of the industrial structure. The mediation effect is still significant. Based on the research in this article, it is recommended to actively implement green credit policies, expand the scale of green credit, firmly implement the innovation-driven development strategy, and at the same time vigorously develop clean energy and reduce energy consumption. The research significance of the article is to explore the impact of green credit on industrial structure upgrading, which has implications for the implementation and promotion of subsequent green credit policies. At the same time, it enriches the research on green credit. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\"\\n\"Nocera Alves Junior P., Costa Melo I., de Moraes Santos R., da Rocha F.V., Caixeta-Filho J.V.\",\"How did COVID-19 affect green-fuel supply chain? - A performance analysis of Brazilian ethanol sector\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119910291&doi=10.1016%2fj.retrec.2021.101137&partnerID=40&md5=5d70f66b7d9082a6490ce10d588e40dd\",\"The COVID-19 pandemic affected many supply chains worldwide, including the Brazilian green-fuel ethanol supply chain.

However, by focusing on a limited set of financial instruments (e.g., green bonds, carbon credits), actors (e.g., real estate developers, private investors, international organisations), and projects (e.g., large-scale infrastructure), existing studies overlook the heterogeneity of financial relations, initiatives, and actors that make possible urban climate action. This includes, for instance, the deployment of decentralised, small-scale renewable energy technologies, or community-led adaptation efforts. In this paper, I explore how theorisations of heterogeneous/hybrid infrastructure, diverse economies, and popular economies can advance current research, through the analysis of three decentralised renewable energy projects in France, the UK, and Zimbabwe.

For that, steam explosion (SE) pretreatment stands out as a technique to overcome its recalcitrant nature and enable byproduct valorization. In this study, solid and liquid fractions were separated after pretreatment for saccharification and biogas production, respectively. The research relevance relies on the contribution to environment decarbonization and monetization of decarbonization credits (CBIO) generated from the production of renewable fuel from waste biomass under different operational conditions (with and without pretreatment). RESULTS: Liquid hydrolysate generated by SE condition at 210 \\xc2\\xb0C and 15 min led to the highest biomethane production (292 NmL CH4\\xc2\\xa0g CODfed\\xe2\\x88\\x921). Similarly, high-severity pretreatment also favored the enzymatic hydrolysis yield of the solid fraction (49%). In terms of environment decarbonization, SE promoted not only a lower carbon intensity when compared to the process without any pretreatment (3.8 vs. 6.4 g CO2eq MJ\\xe2\\x88\\x921), but also increased the monetization of decarbonization credits by 175%, which represented a potential revenue of US $1 481 330. CONCLUSION: High temperatures of SE pretreatment of CH at 210 \\xc2\\xb0C were able to promote biogas production and fermentable sugars. In addition, the process reduced carbon emissions and increased the revenue from CBIO commercialization.

In such a case, at least one-to-one correspondence between the tax and energy intensity may help promote renewable energy use if they are subsidized and allowed to come under the provision of tax credit or tax exemption. Since price instruments do not produce any revenue recycling effect, policymakers can trade-off between increasing corporate tax and generating employment. Therefore, environmental regulations should strictly relate to increase energy efficiency and bring the manufacturing sector out of the productivity dilemma. Also, as evidence from the empirical analysis, there is an urgent need to substitute vintage capital with new capital and better technology.

This paper aims to review the different public policies used to promote the integration of photovoltaic technology into smart grids, taking the case of Portugal as reference. An analysis of previous supporting policies is performed both in Portugal and some European countries; these policies consist of feed-in tariffs, feed-in premiums, green certificates, electricity compensation, direct capital subsidies, and tax credits. The policies currently in force in Portugal no longer aim to support the technology; instead, they intend to promote it. Energy communities, local markets, and solar auctions are examples of public policies that are currently being used, not only to promote PV power but also the development of microgrids. Finally, the Portuguese solar auctions of 2019 and 2020 are analyzed and compared. It is concluded that auctions are a very effective way of expanding the installed capacity of the PV technology in the country and have more weight on promoting the technology than other promoting policies currently being used. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 by the authors.

Seeds of barley were exposed to the following treatments for three weeks: 100% treated wastewater, treated wastewater mixed with: 0.05 g ml-1 A. vera alcoholic extract (Alc Ext) or 0.05 g ml-1 A. vera water extract (Wat Ext), 0.15 g ml-1 Alc Ext or 0.15 g ml-1 Wat Ext. Similar test doses were prepared for untreated wastewater. A separate set of seeds was prepared using distilled water as a control. Germination rate, fresh and dry weight, protein content, MDA content and mitotic index were determined. Results: Untreated wastewater caused significant reduction in fresh weight while both treated and untreated wastewater showed insignificant decrease in dry weight of barley. No significant change in MDA contents were observed in all treatments, except for addition of 0.15 A. vera water extract to untreated wastewater. Protein content showed an increase in both treated wastewater (insignificant) and untreated wastewater (significant). Addition of A. vera extracts increased accumulation of protein in both shoot and root. A. vera alcoholic extract promoted significant increase in both root and shoot protein of treated wastewater, but only shoot protein of untreated wastewater. A significant reduction in mitotic index was induced by wastewater, while addition of A. vera extracts stimulated significant increase in mitotic index. Interpretation: A. vera possess reactive oxygen species scavenging ability and enzyme conservation activity in addition to stimulatory effects on cell proliferation and cell-cycle process that add a modulation credit on protein content and mitotic index of barley. \\xc2\\xa9 Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India)\"\\n\"Zhang K., Zhou X.\",\"Is Promoting Green Finance in Line with the Long-Term Market Mechanism? The Perspective of Chinese Commercial Banks\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129343545&doi=10.3390%2fmath10091374&partnerID=40&md5=fee7df771db8f78d90184e09e9d98519\",\"Green finance is a sustainable force in promoting green development. China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s social financing structure determines the key role that green credit plays in sustainable development. Under the dual pressure of future economic downturn and huge capital gaps, it is worth exploring whether to continue promoting green credit that conforms to the long-term market mechanism. From the perspective of Chinese commercial banks, this paper analyzes whether promoting green credit is compatible with the incentives and their profit maximization goals. To this end, the research in this paper is based on the following three aspects: (1) Based on financial analysis, this paper reveals the different pricing of green industries in the capital market and credit market and explains the mechanism through which green credit policies improve the operating conditions of commercial banks; (2) combined with the conclusions from the literature and financial analysis, the influence of different index types on the modeling results is analyzed, and it is determined that the main reasons causing a decline in the return on assets are the excessive expansion of capital and the decline in internal resource-use efficiency; (3) a data envelopment model (more accurately, SBM-DDF) with undesirable outputs is established to dynamically analyze the operating efficiency of Chinese commercial banks, and the role of green credit in improving efficiency is studied. The main conclusions of this paper are as follows: if Chinese commercial banks increase their proportion of green credit, they can not only increase their profit scale but also improve and optimize the allocation of their internal resources, thus improving their operating efficiency. The main sample of this study comprises 43 commercial banks in China from 2007 to 2020. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 by the authors.

Following the government\\'s environmental policies, MSPs (i.e., outsourcing and insourcing alternatives) determine their strategies and offer platform-driven solutions to the manufacturing entrepreneur pursuing green innovation. Using benchmark models, we first analyze decisions made by the manufacturing entrepreneur and the MSP under the deregulated scenarios. We then develop a three-level game-theoretical model and sequentially characterize the decision-making behavior of players under three platform power structures. The model outcomes are compared by considering the government\\'s policymaking approach and platforms\\' power structure. Results reveal that, when coupled with appropriately designed trade-credit and revenue-sharing mechanisms and the government\\'s innovation-based social welfare approach, the internal MSP system always outperforms the external alternative. Our study demonstrates that a win-win agreement among GTD players can only be achieved if the MSPs take the balance of power and remain committed to empowering the initiated sustainable ecosystem. In power struggle scenarios, however, GTD players prioritize the internal MSP over the external MSP. To fulfill the GTD goals, players are encouraged to use their structural and legislative power and adjust their strategies, investment decisions, and power preferences accordingly. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Kim Y., Kim S.-I.\",\"Environmental Risk and Credit Ratings, and the Moderating Effect of Market Competition\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128704418&doi=10.3390%2fijerph19095341&partnerID=40&md5=a65a53507fe14b82d7eff7d37b429afd\",\"This study examines the relationship between environmental risk and corporate bond credit ratings, and the moderating effect of market competition. We focus on Korean firms that are facing increasing risk of environmental crisis after the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, the Korean government has been controlling businesses while promoting policies to transform the economy into a low-energy, low-carbon economy. We find that a firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s greenhouse gas emission and energy consumption, which are direct indicators of environmental risk, are negatively associated with bond credit ratings. We also report that the negative effect of environmental risk on credit ratings is stronger in firms with low market competition. This study contributes to prior research by improving the understanding of the effect of environmental risk on credit ratings. In particular, it is significant to examine the effect of environmental risk, measured as direct environmental performance not affected by green washing, on credit rating. Therefore, we shed light on environment-oriented management beyond the determinants of credit ratings, which have been discussed in previous studies. We also suggest that policymakers need to manage market competition in terms of environmental justice, given that market competition has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between environmental risk and credit ratings. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 by the authors.

Although information effects are widely documented in stated preference studies, the reasons underlying the effects are less established. We focus on information about the policy context of the valuation scenario and examine two pathways which may help explain how including such information in a survey affects stated preferences. We hypothesize and empirically analyze whether the information effects on stated preferences can emerge as a result of changed perceptions about (1) the survey consequentiality and (2) the credibility of the valuation scenario upon facing the additional information. Our results confirm that the frequently found information effects can be present in the context of urban green and climate adaptation. The role of the additional information appears to be negligible for consequentiality perceptions. In contrast, the additional information strengthens the perceived credibility, and this may partially explain the information effects on stated preferences. We conclude that stated preference research may benefit from an increased attention to perceived credibility of the valuation scenario. \\xc2\\xa9 2022, The Author(s).\"\\n\"Spash C.L.\",\"Conservation in conflict: Corporations, capitalism and sustainable development\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127346313&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2022.109528&partnerID=40&md5=e4c7932e10d4b7c58805f4e3ef462f94\",\"In recent times arguments for conservation allying with corporations have been prominent and not least in the advocacy of \\xe2\\x80\\x98new conservation\\xe2\\x80\\x99. This has set up a false dichotomy between traditional conservation and concern for humanity. The supposed intrinsic/instrumental, human/non-human conflict in conservation appears as a diversion from the actual problem which is the modern organisation of society as a capital accumulating machine based on competition and shifting costs on to others. This is particularly evident in the corporate and financial forms of capitalism which have been taking over conservation, and more broadly environmental policy debates. Pragmatism in the form of \\xe2\\x80\\x98new conservation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is argued to involve contradictions going back to Pinchot and encapsulated in modern ideas of sustainable development. This has accelerated environmental destruction and social inequity, exploitation and injustice. The loss of biodiversity will accelerate with the financialisation of Nature via a range of new instruments (e.g. biodiversity banking, trading, offsetting, green/blue bonds, species credits, extinction futures markets and climate catastrophe bonds) that are being promoted by major conservation NGOs (e.g. WWF, TNC). Preserving, empowering and developing alternative social-ecological forms of running economies is then seen as the central issue for protecting both humans and non-humans alike. Divisions in conservation are argued to be real conflicts over the form and function of economic systems and the currently dominant role of capitalism in its corporate and financial forms. \\xc2\\xa9 2022\"\\n\"Namba N., Nakayama T.\",\"Correction to: Taxonomic study of a new green alga, Annulotesta cochlephila gen. et sp. nov.

Using a large sample of 46 countries, we show that green finance significantly reduces carbon emissions in the short and long run. This effect is driven by green bonds issued to support waste and pollution control and improve energy efficiency. The impact of green finance on carbon emissions is more pronounced in developed credit markets and economies with higher innovation success and higher climate change exposure. Our results are robust under the conditions of short-run and long-run homogeneity and the cross-sectional dependence in the sample. \\xc2\\xa9 2022\"\\n\"Sun J., Wang F., Yin H., Zhao R.\",\"Death or rebirth?

We examined how SMEs\\' operational and environmental behaviors changed following China\\'s Green Credit Policy, combining a synthetic control method with a triple difference-in-differences approach. We found that SMEs were likely to exit the market following the Green Credit Policy; however, the surviving SMEs significantly decreased their pollution. We also discovered that foreign firms and firms that received government subsidies were less susceptible to the policy and that the internal cash flow reserves of larger firms hardly changed, while that of SMEs significantly decreased after the policy. This indicates that for some SMEs with relatively poor environmental performance, there is not so much a lack of sufficient financing but rather the absence of strong incentives to change. Thus, financing constraints can stimulate a strong incentive to improve firms\\' environmental performance. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\"\\n\"Guo L., Tan W., Xu Y.\",\"Impact of green credit on green economy efficiency in China\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123189089&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-021-18444-9&partnerID=40&md5=62c9f6fc82f7cc5d85f1190257ccdd0c\",\"With urgent desire of promoting sustainable development, this study explored the impact and affecting mechanism of green credit on green economy efficiency through spatial lag model.

Analysing a sample of 41 Chinese banks from 2007 to 2018, we find that the association between a bank\\'s (relative) green lending as a proportion of its overall loan portfolio, and its credit risk, depends critically on the size and structure of state ownership. While the implementation of China\\'s Green Credit Policy reduces credit risk for the major state-controlled banks, it increases credit risk for the city and regional commercial banks. This performance difference appears largely due to information and expertise asymmetries, with the city and regional commercial banks having less access to information and expertise necessary to evaluate the credit risk of green lending. Understanding this phenomenon can help policymakers tailor green finance policies according to banks\\' characteristics. It also suggests that mechanisms and platforms for the city/regional commercial banks to learn from the major state-controlled banks could be beneficial. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 The Authors.

Two financing models are involved respectively, corresponding to two models and scenarios: full trade credit (FTC) and hybrid trade credit (HTC). The equilibrium points of the two models were obtained, and the influence of key parameters such as different decision-making adjustment speeds and trade credit ratios on the local stability of the system was analyzed. Besides, the expected profits of the supplier and two capital-constrained retailers are discussed. It is found that, compared with the adjustable speeds of the two retailers, the supplier\\'s adjustable speed has a more obvious impact on system stability and expected profits. For the two downstream competitive retailers, the high trade credit ratio leads to the increase in dynamic green levels, wholesale prices, supplier profits, and dynamic pricing of other retailers provided by full trade credit. However, when the market potential is the same, hybrid trade credit may hurt the profits of both retailers. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS)\"\\n\"Li Y., Chen R., Xiang E.\",\"Corporate social responsibility, green financial system guidelines, and cost of debt financing: Evidence from pollution-intensive industries in China\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120169604&doi=10.1002%2fcsr.2222&partnerID=40&md5=3831a5cb78f4700b029b7bb796789f08\",\"Using a sample of publicly listed firms from 2014 to 2019 in pollution-intensive industries in China, this study investigates the effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on corporate cost of debt financing and how the issuance of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreen Financial System Guidelines\\xe2\\x80\\x9d moderates the above relationship.

In order to effectively control the risk of GBMC, the risk of certification institutions, including historical risk, experience risk and ability risk, as well as the risk related to the application enterprise, including its credit risk, satisfaction risk and green index risk, should be taken into account seriously. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.\"\\n\"Kim D.-H., Wu Y.-C., Lin S.-C.\",\"Carbon dioxide emissions, financial development and political institutions\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105885720&doi=10.1007%2fs10644-021-09331-x&partnerID=40&md5=547da2e5a24978ddf39c71287bbb00d1\",\"The paper empirically examines whether and how political institutions shape the nexus between finance and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In a sample of developing and developed countries, it finds that financial development impedes green technology development and thus raises energy use and CO2 emissions, the effects that moderate with improvements in institutional quality. Despite so, there are differences between banks and stock markets, banking competition and concentration, and household and firm credit. Specifically, a more concentrated, less competitive bank-based financial system that lends more to households hinders green technology development and exaggerates energy use and CO2 emissions, and the impacts diminish when institutional quality enhances. Conversely, a more market-oriented financial system with a more competitive and less concentrated banking sector that lends more to private non-financial enterprises promotes green technology development and decreases energy use and CO2 emissions, the effects that weaken when the quality of political institutions betters. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.\"\\n\"Lyu B., Da J., Ostic D., Yu H.\",\"How Does Green Credit Promote Carbon Reduction?

According to the findings, green credit significantly reduces carbon emissions, with the eastern region having the greatest reduction effect. Green credit, with the exception of the western region, has a strong positive impact on disruptive low-carbon innovation. When green credit is combined with disruptive low-carbon innovation, both can significantly reduce carbon emissions; however, the green credit impact diminishes. It can be concluded that disruptive low-carbon innovation has a mediation effect on green credit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contribution to carbon emission reduction. As a result, China should broaden the scope of green credit, concentrate on providing high-quality low-carbon patented technology to science and technology enterprises, and alleviate their financing constraints. Furthermore, these enterprises should increase their output of disruptive low-carbon innovation while lowering carbon emissions through technological innovation.

Such impact is transmitted through increased financial constraints and reduced information transparency. In addition, we find that the impact of green credit policy on the stock price crash risk is more pronounced in firms with weak external governance and a small size.

Design/methodology/approach: The data were gathered from the central banks of all ASEAN countries and the World Bank Indicators between 2008 and 2019. The fixed-effect model and generalized method of moments were used to check the nexus between the constructs. Findings: The results revealed that green finance along with capital formation and government educational expenditures have a positive association with the economic development of ASEAN countries. Research limitations/implications: The study carries some limitations, even though it addresses the underlying variables comprehensively. These limitations provide opportunities to future researchers and authors to expand the scope and accuracy of their study. This research investigation has been supported by the data collected from a single source. Though data collection is maintained correctly, it is still recommended to the upcoming scholars to acquire data to reconfirm the same findings using multiple data sources. The data collected from using some specific data source may be limited in scope and may hinder the comprehensive elaboration of the underlying variables and their mutual relationship. Therefore, the utilization of multiple sources of data collection gives data sufficient to meet the requirement of an okay quality research study. The study is about the economies of ASEAN countries. It checks the influences of green finance development on economic activities and the country\\'s economic growth in ASEAN countries\\' economies. Thus, its results are valid only in the economies of these countries, and this research investigation lacks generalizability. For generalizability, the authors must consider the underlying variables in the world\\'s vast economies. They must adopt a standard scale to judge the impacts of green financial development on economic development. Besides, the study analyzes the economic factors, economic conditions and their effects on the country\\'s position in the world economy in the face of a severe epidemic like COVID-19. Thus, the results may be different in the case of the normal situation. So, a general standardized study is recommended to be conducted in the upcoming days. Originality/value: Green finance has significant capability to improve the global economy, especially amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is beneficial for policymakers to develop policies related to economic development with reference to green finance and also helps future research on a similar topic. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.\"\\n\"Jakada A.H., Mahmood S., Haron N.F., Danmaraya I.A.\",\"REVISITING THE ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNET CURVE IN AFRICA: THE INTERACTIVE ROLE OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132415952&doi=10.46754%2fjssm.2022.4.001&partnerID=40&md5=3168bc81132ef6482ebdc525962466cc\",\"The aim of this study is to revisit the validity of EKC hypothesis in six leading African countries, with interaction effect of financial development and economic growth on the quality of environment over a period of 1970 to 2019.

The empirical results of the study reveal that the EKC hypothesis is supported in these leading African economies. Carbon emissions increase due to foreign direct investment (FDI) and energy consumption. Financial development improves the environmental quality in these leading African economies. The interactive role of financial development and economic growth increases CO2 emissions thereby degrading the quality of environment.

Promoting the coordinated governance of pollution and carbon reduction has become an important starting point to promote the overall green and low-carbon transformation of economic and social development. Facing the multi-objective needs of high-quality development, air quality improvement, carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, air quality measures based on command-and-control method will not be sufficient to achieve the coordinated goals of reducing pollution and carbon. In this paper, a new multi-stakeholder governance model of \\'government-research institution-market-social organization\\' was proposed to realize the governance transformation through the integration of command-and-control and non-command-and-control means. At the top-level design, considering the differences in urban economic development, air pollution and pollution control measures of various industries, pollution and carbon reduction policies should be formulated according to local conditions. In terms of scientific research, carrying out collaborative research on pollution and carbon reduction with discipline integration and departmental cooperation to satisfy the needs of evaluation on pollution and carbon reduction measures, environmental data, resource sharing and implementation of research outcomes. In terms of marketization, bringing voluntary emission reduction transactions and more quota transactions in high emission industries into the carbon emission trading market, synergizing environmental rights transactions such as emission rights, energy use rights and green power, strengthening the pollution and carbon reduction through market tools. In terms of governance mechanisms, giving full play to the role of social organizations, using digital information systems to build a third-party environmental credit platform, promoting communication and interaction among key stakeholders such as government, enterprises, financial institutions and the public. Our study shows that the proposed model can effectively build a multi-stakeholder governance system, synergize government, research institutions, market and social organizations into a unified platform, and solve the new demand of pollution and carbon collaborative reduction.

In effect, the issues of green, social, and sustainability (GSS) bonds are gaining more and more importance in the Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) financial markets. They are specifically focused on raising funding for public expenditure programs that contribute to achieving several objectives, such as climate and environmental projects, energy efficiency, pollution prevention, sustainable agriculture, fishery and forestry, etc. The main objective of this paper is to provide a literature revision of the evolution of the issuance of GSS bonds in the LAC region and to analyze the economic growth of the countries which issue this type of bond. We will apply multiple linear regression to relate the economic growth of some countries of the LAC region with the variables proposed by the IFC Emerging Market Green Bonds Report (2019). It has been shown that the economic growth of the countries in the LAC region that are issuing GSS bonds is significantly related to the Sovereign Green Issuance (Total Planned), the ratio of Private Credit/GDP, and the Rule of Law Index. However, this research has had the limitation of the scarcity of available data in the LAC markets. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 by the authors.

The burden is heavier for the more vulnerable economies in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), who must juggle meeting strict greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reduction goals, significant fossil-fuel reliance, and pressure to respond to current pandemic concerns that require an increasing share of limited public resources, while facing severe repercussions for non-compliance. Thus, the main goals of this research are: (i) to generate reliable aggregate GHG projections for CEE countries; (ii) to assess whether these economies are on track to meet their binding pollution reduction targets; (iii) to pin-point countries where more in-depth analysis using spatial inventories of GHGs at a finer resolution is further needed to uncover specific areas that should be targeted by additional measures; and (iv) to perform geo-spatial analysis for the most at-risk country, Poland. Seven statistical and machine-learning models are fitted through automated forecasting algorithms to predict the aggregate GHGs in nine CEE countries for the 2019\\xe2\\x80\\x932050 horizon. Estimations show that CEE countries (except Romania and Bulgaria) will not meet the set pollution reduction targets for 2030 and will unanimously miss the 2050 carbon neutrality target without resorting to carbon credits or offsets. Austria and Slovenia are the least likely to meet the 2030 emissions reduction targets, whereas Poland (in absolute terms) and Slovenia (in relative terms) are the farthest from meeting the EU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2050 net-zero policy targets. The findings thus stress the need for additional measures that go beyond the status quo, particularly in Poland, Austria, and Slovenia. Geospatial analysis for Poland uncovers that Krakow is the city where pollution is the most concentrated with several air pollutants surpassing EU standards. Short-term projections of PM2.5 levels indicate that the air quality in Krakow will remain below EU and WHO standards, highlighting the urgency of policy interventions. Further geospatial data analysis can provide valuable insights into other geo-loca-tions that require the most additional efforts, thereby, assisting in the achievement of EU climate goals with targeted measures and minimum socio-economic costs. The study concludes that statistical and geo-spatial data, and consequently research based on these data, complement and enhance each other. An integrated framework would consequently support sustainable development through bettering policy and decision-making processes. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 by the authors.

This paper constructed an improved super-SBM-DEA efficiency measurement model and combined it with the window analysis method to measure the green technology innovation efficiency (GTIE) of Chinese provinces from 2006 to 2018. Then, based on the PVAR model, the impulse response function and Monte Carlo simulation were used to study the dynamic impact of various variables of technology and finance on GTIE. Finally, the variance decomposition was used to explore the contribution degree of each variable of technology and finance to improving GTIE. The results revealed the following: (1) the average value of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s provincial GTIE from 2006 to 2018 was 0.42, which is relatively low and shows a trend of volatility and rising. (2) From the impulse response results, it could be seen that various variables of technology and finance have always had a positive impact on GTIE. However, there are differences in the influence degree, shock effect, and dynamic transmission mechanism. (3) The results of the variance decomposition showed that government financial technology investment had the highest contribution to the improvement of GTIE, followed by bank technology credit, then by enterprise independent R&D investment, and finally venture capital.

Green credit is one of the important financial services in green finance. In order to construct a more perfect multiple attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) method, this paper proposes a new evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) model based on prospect theory and probabilistic uncertain linguistic term set (PT-PULTS-EDAS model). The PT-PUTLS-EDAS model fully takes the psychological state of decision-makers into account the mathematical logic of the method, which is more suitable for the problem of MAGDM in reality. In addition, the new PT-PULTS-EDAS model reduces the decision-maker\\'s subjective judgment on some objective situations as much as possible. The model uses Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method to obtain the initial attribute weights and makes use of the weighting function to alter the initial weights so that successfully avoids the distortion of subjective judgment to the actual probability to some extent.

Several studies have been documented in the extant literature on the nexus between emission, tourism, and economic growth. However, the role of foreign direct investment that highlights either pollution haven or halo hypothesis and pivotal role of domestic credit to private sector in an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) environment is lacking in the extant literature. To this end, this study used augmented mean group (AMG) and method of moment quantile regression (MM-QR) approaches to explore the nexus between per capital income and its square, tourism, foreign direct investment, domestic credit to private sector and CO2 emission. Empirical results show that tourism had a negative significant relationship with CO2 emission. Furthermore, income on the other hand had positive relationship with emissions while its square had negative relationship with emissions. This result also shows the presence of EKC indicating the inverted U-shaped curve. FDI has shown a positive significant relationship with pollution which indicates the pollutant haven hypothesis (PHH), and credit to private sector shows a positive relationship with CO2 emission. On the causality analysis from Dumitrescu and Hurlin panel causality test, there was a bi-directional causality between: tourism and CO2 emission, per capital income and CO2 emission as well as domestic credit and CO2 emission. From these outcomes, it shows that tourism development is not detrimental to environmental quality in the Mediterranean region investigated. However, there is need for caution on FDI influx and dirty economic activities that might compromise environmental quality in the study bloc. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\"\\n\"Feng Y., Shen Q.\",\"How does green credit policy affect total factor productivity at the corporate level in China: the mediating role of debt financing and the moderating role of financial mismatch\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120557282&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-021-17521-3&partnerID=40&md5=8282464b28335c6daffe092b87a7b26c\",\"Taking the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreen Credit Guidelines\\xe2\\x80\\x9d issued in 2012 as a quasi-natural experiment and employing the A-share listed enterprises scanning from 2008 to 2020 as the research sample, this study has investigated the impact of green credit policy on total factor productivity at the corporate level in China, with the consideration of the mediating role of debt financing and the moderating role of financial mismatch.

To date, however, research on how state owners of infrastructure enable and react to the entry of financial logics into such domains remains limited. This paper mobilizes the case of Eandis, a Flemish energy grid company, as a typical case to examine the causal mechanisms involved when state-owned utilities become subject to financial logics. During the 2000s, Flemish municipalities increased their ownership of Eandis, while the company deepened its debt exposure to optimize return on capital. In 2016, Eandis aimed to attract private financial equity and selected a Chinese investment fund as a potential co-shareholder. Although this buy-in was blocked, the conditions under which the state-owned company became increasingly entangled with financial markets remain unchanged and warrant a deeper examination. To explain this trajectory, we identify two causal mechanisms in the fields of market-making and ownership strategies by the multiscalar state. First, we show how regulatory models caused Eandis to focus on financial metrics such as credit ratings, subjecting management to financial market disciplines. Second, we find that budgetary constraints, combined with top-down utility governance, have made municipalities dependent on financial returns on utilities. The interaction between market-making and financial ownership strategies institutionalizes a financialized gridlock, in which municipal shareholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 interests conflict with the need for low consumer fees and green grid investment. We argue that reforming the regulatory framework and strengthening fiscal solidarity across state layers would allow states to develop non-financialized strategies. \\xc2\\xa9 The Author(s) 2021.\"\\n\"Roy P.K., Shaw K.\",\"Developing a multi-criteria sustainable credit score system using fuzzy BWM and fuzzy TOPSIS\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111113765&doi=10.1007%2fs10668-021-01662-z&partnerID=40&md5=0b95a0b0249af99e1fb86c8190becfba\",\"Sustainability has emerged as a dominating paradigm across global institutions as a critical component for their prospects. Organisations all across the globe must commit to strengthen the values as a participant in sustainable development. Financial institutions are no exception; they are also being pushed to undertake many sustainable initiatives, such as increasing socially meaningful, relevant, and sustainable projects. In addition, they may contribute to sustainable growth by enacting a green banking policy. To promote the green financing strategy, this study proposes a multi-criteria sustainable credit scoring model considering triple bottom line attributes (economic, environmental, and social) besides managerial attributes. The model is built on a novel hybrid approach that combines the fuzzy best\\xe2\\x80\\x93worst method (BWM) with the fuzzy technique for order preferences by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS). The fuzzy BWM was used to weigh factors, while the fuzzy TOPSIS was utilised to evaluate borrowers. The integration of fuzzy set theory assisted in overcoming decision-making ambiguity. An empirical analysis was performed to demonstrate the utility of the proposed model. According to the study\\xe2\\x80\\x99s findings, the most important attribute for sustainable credit scoring is environmental and social sustainability and financial sustainability. On policy implications, regulators could also use the framework as a benchmark to counsel financial institutions on how to include different sustainable criteria into their credit lending process. Furthermore, financial institutions could use the proposed technique as a part of a sustainable lending policy to identify potential borrowers engaged in sustainable business. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.\"\\n\"Zhang J., Luo Y., Ding X.\",\"Can green credit policy improve the overseas investment efficiency of enterprises in China?\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124427316&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.130785&partnerID=40&md5=cc295e6a071fb71352af93a1aaafdc7a\",\"Nowadays, countries around the world are increasingly emphasizing the green concept in their foreign investment cooperation. As an important means to guide the green development of China\\'s economy, green credit policy may affect the overseas investment decisions of Chinese enterprises and ultimately affect the investment efficiency. Based on the overseas direct investment data of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2007 to 2019, this paper calculates the overseas investment efficiency at the enterprise level by expanded Richardson model, and further tests the influence of green credit policy on the overseas investment efficiency of Chinese enterprises. The results show that green credit policy can improve the efficiency of enterprises\\' overseas investment, especially for state-owned enterprises and enterprises in low environmental regulations areas. Therefore, China\\'s financial institutions should strengthen the implementation of green credit policies and formulate differentiated credit schemes for enterprises with different characteristics under the supervision of relevant departments.

We provide empirical evidence of the relations between existing policy instruments, organizational capabilities of firms and the adoption of different types of green technologies. We use a unique firm level panel dataset of 2562 Spanish manufacturing firms from 2008 to 2014 to carry out the empirical analysis. Our results show, first, that policy instruments drive adoption of green innovation more than organizational capabilities. Second, environmental taxation seems to be ineffective at stimulating the adoption of eco-innovation. Third, both investment subsidies and tax credits do imply higher levels of investments in green technologies. Tax incentives seem to mostly foster cleaner production technologies, while subsidies are used to finance all types of eco-innovations. Fourth, human resources as green employees are positively related with environmental investments. Finally, dynamic capabilities as the introduction of environmental management systems are correlated particularly with cleaner production investments oriented to reduce energy consumption. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Xu S., Zhu H.\",\"Does Green Governance Efficiency and Green Finance Polices Matters in Sustainable Environment: Implications for Public Health\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128222003&doi=10.3389%2ffpubh.2022.861349&partnerID=40&md5=3c358efbd0ebb5ea9feb12479cbc89db\",\"Rapid and widespread changes in the environment and climate, such as rising temperatures, water and air pollution, floods, and droughts, disease vector migration are putting human health at risk.

An important content of the green credit policy is to require banking and financial institutions to tighten the credit exposure of industries of \\xe2\\x80\\x98high pollution and high energy consumption\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and industries with overcapacity, so as to use economic leverage to curb their blind expansion and reduce energy consumption by controlling external financing. This paper examined the impact and the lingering effects of the green credit policy on external financing, economic growth and energy consumption in the manufacturing industry, which was most influenced by the green credit policy, from 2003 to 2016 by using the DID method. Furthermore, this paper estimated the dynamic endogenous relationships among external financing, economic growth and energy consumption with two-step system GMM model to investigate the influential path of the green credit policy. The results showed that: the green credit policy had a significant negative impact on the external financing of manufacturing industry, but its negative impact on the economic growth and energy consumption of manufacturing industry was not statistically significant, and the effect of the green credit policy had a dynamic feature of weakening with time. Additionally, in the manufacturing industry, there was a bilateral causal relationship between the energy consumption and economic growth of the control group industry and the processing group industry. There was a bilateral causal relationship between the economic growth and external financing of the control group industries in the manufacturing industry. There was a unilateral causal relationship between the economic growth and external financing of the processing group industries in the manufacturing industry, while the external causality existed between the control group industries and the processing group industries in the manufacturing industry. The causal relationship between the financing and energy consumption was not statistically significant. At present, the transmission path of the green credit policy is that the green credit policy controls external financing, then affects economic growth and ultimately inhibits energy consumption, but the effectiveness of the path is not statistically significant. The conclusion of this paper provides policy reference and scientific basis for the adjustment and improvement of green credit. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 The Authors\"\\n\"Jakada A.H., Mahmood S., Ahmad A.U., Sani A.I., Yola A.T.\",\"The effect of economic factors on the quality of the environment in African countries: An application of panel quantile regressions\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133258569&doi=10.34172%2fEHEM.2022.10&partnerID=40&md5=57c90e517b888968ef6f010bd1777de7\",\"Background: To mitigate the climate change, several researches have been conducted to determine the determinant factors of CO2 emissions. Nonetheless, a consensus was failed to reach yet on the issue because many of the previous studies did not deliberate the undetected individual heterogeneity across countries. The study aimed to investigate the effects of economic growth, foreign direct investment and financial development within the research background of seven leading African economies over the 49-year period from 1970 to 2019. Methods: In this study, the determinant factors of environmental quality were examined by employing a panel quantile regression. The advantage of the method is considering the distributional heterogeneity to provide a detailed description regarding the driving factors of carbon emissions. Results: It was revealed that the effects of determinants on CO2 emissions are heterogeneous. The quantile regression estimate describes that the influence of economic growth on CO2 emissions is positive and higher at the 50th quantile than in other classes of quantile. The effect of financial development on CO2 emissions is higher and positive at the 90th quantile compared to other categories of quantile. The FDI influence on CO2 emissions is heterogeneous across different quantiles and the coefficient is significant and larger at the 10th quantile than in all the other quantiles. Conclusion: In addition, the study recommends that environmental policies that minimize emissions should be enforced for the purpose of making the environment cleaner, FDI should be environmentally friendly, and relevant incentives are required to redirect private credits towards green projects and renewable energy development. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 The Author(s).

This study employed 17033 panel data from 2010 to 2019 to conduct empirical research on green credit policy, green innovation, financial performance, and ESG performance. Our regression results of ESG factors model showed that although Green Credit Guidelines (GCG) policy failed to promote green innovation and environmental impact of green enterprises, it could improve the financial performance of green enterprises. Through the combined approach of the difference-in-difference (DID) regression and fixed effect (FE) models, we also found the intervening influence of green innovation and financial performance within the relationship of GCG and ESG scores. Green companies benefit more from green policy. However, GCG is far from meeting the expectation of improving ESG performance through green innovation. Additionally, in order to explore the interactions between individual dimensions of ESG indicators, Kernel balance test and two-step Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) system were applied in a dynamic panel to further investigate our model.

The study used an explanatory research design and a quantitative research approach. Quarterly secondary time series data over 8 years (2013\\xe2\\x80\\x932020) were utilized. More specifically, the study used Johnson co-integration test and vector error correction model to investigate the long and short-run relationship among variables. The study\\xe2\\x80\\x99s findings imply that monetary policy, as measured by interest rates and the broad money supply, has a mixed effect on the level of green financing. Interest rates, in particular, have a negative and significant relationship with green finance in both the long and short run. However, a broad money supply has a positive but insignificant relationship with green finance in the long run. Private investment has a positive and significant relationship with green financing in both the long and short run. The study also used inward and outward foreign direct investment, and greenhouse gas as a control variable of the study. The study finding implies that inward foreign direct investment has a positive and significant relationship with green financing in both the long and short run. On the other hand, outward foreign direct investment and the level of greenhouse gas have a negative and significant relationship with green finance in both the long and short run. The study also discovered that over time series, disturbance in domestic private investment was the most determinant factor in forecast error variance of green financing. In addition, the result of document analysis shows that the majority of Hungarian credit institutions are dealing with their corporate strategy rather than their sustainability strategy. Hence, progressive approaches are needed from the credit institution to frame their strategy under the concept of sustainable development goals. The finding of this study will contribute to the existing literature on the study area, provide suggestions on green finance and green monetary policy approaches, provide implications on key stakeholders of green financing, as well as the experience of different economies. The study advises central banks, credit institutions, and regulatory authorities to consider both neoliberal and reformist approaches of green finance and green monetary policies in aid to increase green investment. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 by the authors.

The index system of GF and HQED is constructed by selecting relevant index data from 2007 to 2017. The index of GF and HQED is measured by the entropy value method. Next, the coupling coordination degree (CCD) and spatial association strength are calculated based on the index using the coupling coordination degree model and the gravity model. Then the driving factors of the CCD between GF and HQED are analyzed by using geographic detectors. Finally, the spatial association network is constructed and its robustness is studied. The research results show that the coupling coordination degree between GF and HQED in each province is generally low, with strong regional heterogeneity, and the coupling coordination degree shows a trend of decay from the eastern region to the western region, but the western region has more room for development. Green credit, green, coordination, and sharing are the strong driving factors of the CCD between GF and HQED. The network of spatial association between GF and HQED in each province is gradually tightened, making the western peripheral provinces more closely connected with the eastern provinces through the intermediate node provinces. The network robustness of GF and HQED is more influenced by provinces with higher node degree values. Accordingly, the article proposes that China should continuously improve relevant GF policies, environmental disclosure systems, enhance green innovation technology and guide private capital to enter the GF market. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 by the authors.

This is particularly so following the devastating COVID-19 pandemic. However, while a growing amount of literature has been deliberating debt financing in sustainable investment, less ink has been spilt on equity financing in this area, and even less scholarship has explored the role of government and law in supporting sustainable venture capital (\\xe2\\x80\\x98VC\\xe2\\x80\\x99) funds.

The contractarian approach includes effective contracting covering the entire VC cycle in sustainable investment. It aims to provide strong incentives for all participants, ranging from investors, entrepreneurs and fund managers, to credit-rating agencies and evaluation firms. In the same vein, this paper seeks to craft a role for regulators that facilitates the simultaneous availability of several factors in a sustainable VC cycle (i.e., fund raising, investment and exit). In the fund-raising stage, governments can play an active role by expanding the source of financing for sustainable VC funds and enacting detailed and targeted legislation. In the VC investment stage, sustainable VC funds should make full use of their strong corporate governance rights and monitoring tasks to ensure that start-ups deliver on their sustainable promises. In the exit stage, a specialised sustainability board is strongly recommended to offer viable exit options, together with greater standardisation and comparability in sustainability information disclosure, and regulatory support for trustworthy sustainable impact rating agencies to sustain investor confidence. \\xc2\\xa9 2022, T.M.C.

Promoting cycling will help enhance the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreen City\\xe2\\x80\\x9d initiative in Thailand. While several studies have addressed social issues of cyclists, the environmental impacts and economic viability of cycling infrastructure are yet unknown. Quantifying its environmental impact and the costing aspect are essential to prove that cycling would positively affect a city. This study compares the expected environmental and economic impacts before and after constructing a bicycle lane in Mahasarakham, Thailand. METHODS: This study uses life cycle assessment and life cycle costing to assess a bicycle lane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s environmental and economic viability. Life cycle assessment and life cycle costing are tools used to analyze environmental impact and cost during the life cycle of a product or service. The scope of this study covers the processing of raw material acquisition, transportation, construction, use, and disposal. The functional unit set for this study is the use of a bicycle lane for one year. The environmental impact examined is greenhouse gas emissions along the product\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life cycle (the so-called \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccarbon footprint\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).FINDINGS: According to the results, approximately 0.2 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of carbon footprint could have been reduced in 2020 had a bicycle lane been installed. The use phase plays the leading role in reducing carbon footprint. The reduction in environmental impacts is due to reduced fuel consumption by cars and motorcycles when bicycles are used. Even though a low rate (26%) of road users, who participated in this research, were willing to ride bikes had a bicycle lane been provided, a considerable amount of environmental impact could still have been reduced. CONCLUSION: The carbon footprint expected to be reduced in a year is valued at about 4.7 million baht of carbon credit. In comparison, the life cycle cost of bicycle lanes for one year is approximately 3.7 million baht. Furthermore, it is anticipated that had a bicycle lane been installed since 2015, the city would have reduced overall carbon footprint emissions by more than 1.15 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2020. Therefore, the results of environmental impact and cost assessment from this study are helpful for urban environmental management. \\xc2\\xa9 2022. GJESM.

At the same time, China\\'s provincial panel data from 2011 to 2018 are selected to test the impact of fintech innovation and green finance on green growth, and its mechanism. It turns out that fintech and green finance significantly promotes green economic growth. At the same time, the impact of fintech and green finance on green growth has obvious regional heterogeneity, that is, the impact in eastern China is significantly stronger than that in central and western China. Further research shows that fintech innovation mainly promotes green economic growth through green credit and green investment. Therefore, fintech innovation can promote green economic growth by improving the development level of green finance, which has great reference significance for most countries. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 The Authors\"\\n\"Cheng Q., Lai X., Liu Y., Yang Z., Liu J.\",\"The influence of green credit on China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s industrial structure upgrade: evidence from industrial sector panel data exploration\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119197019&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-021-17399-1&partnerID=40&md5=f644316703dc7e5719b7007e87352ee5\",\"The green credit is one of the effective tools to save energy and reduce pollution, which mainly applies in industry. Thus, this paper explores the impact of green credit on the upgrading of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s industrial structure from the perspective of industrial sectors, by means of a dynamic panel model with the dada from 2005 to 2016. The upgrading of industrial structure is divided into three dimensions to be analyzed\\xe2\\x80\\x94rationalization of industrial structure (RIS), advancement of industrial structure (AIS), and greenization of industrial structure (GIS). The empirical results are also explained by four influence mechanisms\\xe2\\x80\\x94resource allocation, technological innovation, credit catalysis, and policy guidance mechanism. This paper finds that on the national level, green credit has a positive impact on the upgrading of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s industrial structure and plays a significant role in promoting the greenization and advancement of industrial structure. However, on the regional level, the effect of green credit is more complex. First, green credit has a significant positive effect on the GIS in the eastern, central, and western regions of China, which suggests that green credit is conductive to the cleaner production of industry across the country. Second, green credit also has a positive impact on the AIS in these three regions, but the effect is only significant in the eastern region. Third, in terms of the RIS, the effect of green credit is positive but not significant in the eastern and central regions. However, it is negative, not significant as well, in the western region, which can be explained from the perspective of the resource allocation and technological innovation mechanism. In addition, there is a significant positive correlation between the previous period and the current value of RIS, AIS, and GIS, which indicates that there is a significant positive inertia dynamic feature in the upgrading of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s industrial structure. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\"\\n\"Lai X., Yue S., Chen H.\",\"Can green credit increase firm value?

Subsequently, European Union countries began to implement the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfifth Environmental Action Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on 1 January 1993, which effectively combined voluntary environmental agreements with corporate self-regulation.

This paper empirically examines the promotion effect of the voluntary environmental agreement on green technology innovation, finds the shortcomings of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voluntary environmental agreement regulation, and puts forward specific improvement strategies to promote the growth of green technology innovation more effectively. It is found that government environmental protection education, enterprise ecological ethics construction, market effectiveness, and information technology support have obvious promoting effects on green product innovation, green process innovation, and end management innovation.

Green credit policy (GCP) can guide capital flow from high-energy consumption and high-pollution industries to technologically advanced emerging industrial sectors, so as to support the development of green industries and curb the emissions of polluting industries. In order to explore the extent to which the goal of green credit policy in China has been achieved, based on the micro data of China\\'s listed enterprises from 2009 to 2017, this paper explores the impact of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreen Credit Guidelines\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (2012 Guidelines) policy on the green transformation of heavy polluting industries (HPIs) by using a Difference in Differences (DID) and Propensity Score Matched-Difference in Differences (PSM-DID) models.

The results show that the 2012 Guidelines significantly promote the green transformation of HPIs, through debt financing constraints and equity financing constraints. The effect of 2012 Guidelines on green transformation of small-scale and private enterprises is more pronounced. However, the positive effect of 2012 Guidelines on the green transformation of HPIs has not been sustained in the long term. Our study provides an insight for decision makers to manage green transformation of HPIs from the GCP perspective, by informing the economic consequences of GCP and pushing the industrial transformation towards green development. \\xc2\\xa9 2021\"\\n\"Hu Q., Li X., Feng Y.\",\"Do Green Credit Affect Green Total Factor Productivity?

The findings show that, firstly, on the whole, green credit significantly increases GTFP, which is tested by the panel regression model. Secondly, according to the result of the panel quantile model, the increasing effect of green credit on GTFP is strengthened by the improvement of GTFP. Thirdly, green credit has heterogeneous impact on GTFP, which is reflected in economic development with different level, especially for different degrees of environmental regulation. Fourthly, under the full samples, green credit impacts GTFP through green technology innovation, but it has no effect on energy consumption structure. Besides, the influence mechanism is heterogeneous in the variation of sample characteristics.

The paper found that green financial policy has effectively reduced pollution and energy consumption in high pollution and high energy consuming industries. As a means of verifying the reliability of the results, propensity score matching difference-in-differences (PSM-DID) applies the match kernels and radius method before the DID. Furthermore, this paper explored the regional and industry heterogeneity in incremental carbon emission reductions. This is the first paper to use Guidelines to measure green finance, in order to achieve indicator innovation and provide corresponding policy advice. To reduce carbon emissions, the government must strengthen the implementation of green credit policy and create a green financial environment tailored to local needs.

Commercial banks as an important part of the national economy, the innovation of green credit model can not only promote the development of green finance, but also lead the high-quality development of China\\'s environmental protection industry. However, because the green credit model of China\\'s commercial banks started late and developed slowly, there are still some problems in many aspects, which need to be further optimized and adjusted. Based on this, this paper first expounds the existing main green credit models of China\\'s commercial banks. Secondly, taking China Construction Bank as an example, it focuses on the green credit model of the pilot Bank of China Construction Bank. It is found that the overall proportion of green credit model is relatively low, the green credit model is single and lack for innovation as well as specialization. Finally, aiming at the above problems, this paper puts forward specific suggestions to promote the innovation and development of green credit model of commercial banks in China. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 ACM.\"\\n\"Xiao Z., Yu L., Liu Y., Bu X., Yin Z.\",\"Does Green Credit Policy Move the Industrial Firms Toward a Greener Future?

The estimated mediation models reveal that after the implementation of the green credit policy, reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions can be attribute to the increased environmental investment and improved energy consumption intensity. Moreover, the green credit policy is also significantly effective in mitigating the discharge of other common industrial pollutants.

In particular, the high cost of transporting green hydrogen is bottlenecking the international trading and wider adoption of hydrogen for global carbon natural objectives. In order to explore incentives for the global hydrogen economy and develop new pathways towards the carbon neutral future, the concept of hydrogen credit is proposed by this research and a framework of trading hydrogen credits similar to carbon credits in the international market is established.

This paper studies two financing strategies of a carbon-dependent manufacturer in an e-commerce supply chain, which are called bank credit and cost-sharing with third-party platform that provides a marketplace. The optimal carbon emission reduction (CER) level, selling price, and service level are investigated. It turns out that the participants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 profits and environmental benefit under two financing strategies are higher than those without financing. In addition, when the commission provided by the platform is low, the manufacturer is more inclined to bank credit, and when the commission is high, it is more sensible to share CER cost with the platform. The impact of government service supervision policies on corporate decision-making is further explored. The results prove that setting an appropriate service threshold and reward-penalty factor is not only conducive to incentivizing the platform to improve service level but also beneficial to the environment and overall social welfare. This paper provides cooperation strategies for manufacturers in green financing in the e-commerce supply chain and provides policy recommendations for the government to implement e-commerce service regulation and promote CER. \\xc2\\xa9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\"\\n\"Ni\\xc8\\x9bescu D.C., Murgu V.\",\"FACTORS SUPPORTING THE TRANSITION TO A \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGREEN\\xe2\\x80\\x9d EUROPEAN ECONOMY AND FUNDING MECHANISMS\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135279059&doi=10.24818%2fEA%2f2022%2f61%2f630&partnerID=40&md5=a661f7ef6060cfe67874ce901ba3d3dc\",\"The transition from fossil fuels to fuels from renewable energy sources can lead to decentralisation of the energy systems, causing structural changes in economic and political relations between countries.

The influences of exogenous factors on two endogenous factors are analyzed: Gross Domestic Product and exports of goods and services, representative of the economic dimension, at the level of selected countries in the European Union. The results obtained show that all four independent variables significantly influence the economic performance of selected countries in the European Union, analyzed in terms of Gross Domestic Product and exports of goods and services.

It is possible to achieve an inclusive growth, which is an economic growth in which the growth benefits are distributed more fairly and the wealth distribution is also more equal.So, a well-thought-out tax policy is a must for the economy to grow and for the government to spend money in a way that is long-term.Consequently, such policies should balance efficiency and equity considerations. It\\'s also important to keep in mind that SD is a goal-oriented process that needs to balance competing interests, such as the need to solve our problems against the constraints we face as a society and not compromise our development objectives.In this context, a connectivity between the 2 is an unavoidable counterpoint, given that a sound tax policy developed by any country is at the heart of mobilizing their own resources to accomplish SD.In light of above, the paper shall seek to address the issues pertaining to normative underpinnings of sustainable development in contemporary era and envisaging vital role of taxes in directing /redirecting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).Since there are so many different kinds of policies out there, this paper is broken up into four parts.

Using a panel data set that includes over 250 elections from 26 European countries, we find that elections held during times of economic growth increase the vote share that Green parties win. This effect is especially robust for national elections, as opposed to elections for the European Parliament. The magnitudes are large enough to potentially alter the number of seats Green parties have in national legislatures. This provides evidence that Green parties are most likely to gain seats when the economy is growing, and support for the existence of an environmental Kuznets curve. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 Elsevier B.V.\"\\n\"Lu J., Easton J.\",\"Research on Green Bond Financing and Corporate Performance: A Moderated Mediation Model\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134743458&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-10385-8_9&partnerID=40&md5=b5c238f13ba14fbfc9a13cd9801bc574\",\"Green bonds have played an increasingly important role in green development as an essential green financial tool since the goal of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccarbon peak and carbon neutral\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was proposed.

Empirically, using a panel data of 30 Chinese provinces and cities from 2004 to 2019, we measure the provincial ER&D and carbon emission performance (Cep), based on which we conduct an econometric analysis. It is observed that Cre promotes Lct (that is, Cre reduces carbon emission and improves Cep). This conclusion still holds after a series of robustness tests and endogeneity treatments. And the impact of Cre on Lct is asymmetrical due to regional differences in physical and geoclimatic characteristics, income levels, and financing constraint\\xc2\\xa0levels.

Finally, the positive effect of Cre on ER&D is significant in high level of Lct regions, but insignificant in low level of Lct regions. Based on this, specific policy recommendations from the perspective of developing Cre and establishing an incentive mechanism for ER&D are put forward. \\xc2\\xa9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\"\\n\"Debrah C., Darko A., Chan A.P.C.\",\"A bibliometric-qualitative literature review of green finance gap and future research directions\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134463488&doi=10.1080%2f17565529.2022.2095331&partnerID=40&md5=630735252be318831af01bf55c998a5b\",\"Green finance (GF) supports the global fight against climate change and its impacts.

This study measures the inequality in green technological innovation via an index and examines the influence of digital finance on that inequality using data from 285 cities in China from 2011 to 2018. The results are as follows: (1) Digital financial development alleviates the inequality in green technological innovation, and the greater the inequality is, the stronger the effect of digital finance. The development of digital finance can help regions lagging behind in terms of green technology to catch up. (2) When the financial supervision and environmental restrictions within a region are strict, the development of digital finance is more effective at reducing the inequality in green technological innovation; a higher capacity for governance in the local government and a smaller digital divide strengthen the positive effects of digital finance. (3) The development of digital finance alleviates interregional inequality in green credit, reduces market segmentation, and increases spending on environmental protection, thus narrowing the gap in the capacity for green innovation between regions. These findings not only enrich the literature on digital finance and green technological innovation but also serve as a reference for governmental departments as they optimize their strategy for developing digital finance and coordinating green development across regions. \\xc2\\xa9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\"\\n\"Zhang L., Yu H., Wu W., Ge Q., Ni S., Song C., Huang K.\",\"Ultrafine Palladium Embedded in N-doped Porous Carbon Material from Carbazole-covalent Triazine Polymer for Green Suzuki-Miyaura Coupling Reaction\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134029050&doi=10.1002%2fcnma.202200215&partnerID=40&md5=7f685d2f213b63db14d16a237c7f1d35\",\"Here, we develop a facile synthesis route to fabricate ultrafine palladium nanoparticles embedded in N-doped porous carbon material (Pd@N-PCM), in which carbazole-covalent triazine polymers obtained by Friedel-Crafts alkylation at room temperature are used as precursor of N-doped carbon.

So, it is challenging for researchers and industry to develop low carbon inventory models that can meet emission reduction targets while maintaining company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s profit. The credit function plays an important role within the organization. Furthermore, with the globalization of the marketing policy, the supplier may provide the retailer a discounted price if the quantity of purchase is large enough, and green inventory management reduces the environmental impact of a business without affecting its profitability. In this paper, we study a profit maximizing green economic order quantity (EOQ) model by considering capacity constraints under order-size dependent trade credit and all-units discount, along with minimizing carbon emissions for a cleaner environment. Shortages are allowed and partially backordered. The paper discusses all the potential cases, which may occur in green inventory models with carbon emission costs under different allowable delay-in-payments. We find that if retailers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 own warehouse capacity is relatively small, they always benefit from enlarging order quantities and renting an extra warehouse. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model.

Third, Chinese financial institutions have not generally responded positively to climate transition risk, but the eastern regions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 financial institutions responded positively. In addition, the green credit policy does not positively affect the response of financial institutions to climate transition risk.

These offerings provide opportunities for other firms to engage with sustainability-conscious consumers, allow consumers to invest in sustainable firms at reasonable rates of return, and remove the need for paper receipts for credit or debit card transactions. Despite the different fields of operation, the case studies show that FinTech offers a unique market opportunity for the case firms to compete with prominent financial service providers and companies in other service sectors, which was not possible earlier.

Hence, the green investment in water, biodiversity protection, waste treatment, resources, and climate change alleviation help in enhancing industrial production. Thus, for the enhancement of green growth, the industries must adopt green financing by making investments in ecology, climate change, and carbon reduction. Despite having the greatest growth in green supply chain management, still, the implementations of greening the product and processes have not been seen properly in many industries. A bibliometric analysis was conducted through VOS viewer version 1.6.7. of last twenty years (2001\\xe2\\x80\\x932021). A total of 2385 articles were retrieved from the Scopus database. The results revealed that China, India, Iran, and Taiwan have a vast collection of articles and have very strong international collaborations. The most cited authors were Sarkis, J., Zhu, Q., and Khan, S.A.R. The results also suggest that green supply chain management research was related to the field of engineering, environmental science, energy sciences, social sciences, and business management. Some new areas are discovered like green innovation, green information technology, green productivity, corporate environmental responsibility, green investments, green credit, and green credit policy. As evidenced from our bibliographic database search, it is observed that integrated work on green supply chain management and green finance is limited, and this makes this research work to be novel.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors first reviewed online data for all LEED registered and certified projects in Jordan, recruited LEED-certified project stakeholders, collected documents related to LEED projects and conducted LEED category credit summaries, financial cost-benefit analyses and spot-checking reported values in local markets. The authors then visited projects sites and interviewed various project stakeholders to understand better stakeholders\\' decision-making processes concerning LEED and relevant factors (financial, branding, cultural, political, etc.). Findings: Obtaining LEED certification in Jordan was financially feasible as evinced in both the quantitative analysis and interviews. However, the authors found that there was very limited interest in LEED among Jordanian developers. Barriers included widespread cynicism toward green building concepts as well as a lack of local expertise in installing and maintaining green technologies. To overcome these barriers, the authors recommend that green building initiatives place a greater emphasis on education and public-promotion activities. Research limitations/implications: The research data were limited to projects that had successfully achieved LEED certification. Broader qualitative research conducted across the Jordanian building community could provide additional insights, but such an investigation is beyond the scope of the current study. Originality/value: The complexity of adapting a Western green building standard (LEED) to a non-Western context is discussed in detail. The findings suggest that understanding regional development challenges, local markets and cultural differences is vital for successfully implementing green building certification systems. \\xc2\\xa9 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.\"\\n\"Singh A., Kalita P.C., Singh R.\",\"Sustainability a Tool for Employment Opportunities\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133032573&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-94277-9_109&partnerID=40&md5=cf8846a13789a9066501c062c9ee7eb1\",\"Environment concerns are on the top priority by the Global policymakers (United Nations (2002) Report of the world summit on sustainable development.

So we have used the Business model canvas tool to understand the gap and requirement of the current scenario. As per the analysis, we have formulated a business model in which all the available government and forest lands will be used for plantation drive for a greener future. The people from town and cities who are not having land for plantation can use government land for the purpose and at the same time employment opportunities for the rural population for nurturing the plants is also generated. The project is a two-way business model, where the rural population will earn living and the urban population will earn carbon credits (the currency of the future).

Every manufacturing system generates some harmful by-products which are the causes of environmental pollution, and it is increasing day by day. As a result, one of the goals of this research is to develop a sustainable smart manufacturing model with less waste and controlled pollution. Moreover, permissible delay in payment is a popular payment method and important proportion of company finance. This research proposes a manufacturing plan for products by controlling pollution through sustainable and smart production under warranty and preventive maintenance performed with trade credits.

A sustainable production model with variable pollution costs is examined under the influence of three pollution control mechanisms to improve the model\\'s applicability. The paper\\'s novelty lies in introducing pollution control costs and pollution control mechanisms together in a flexible, sustainable production system. In comparison with the other models, the model with a variable pollution cost appears to be more sustainable as, in this case, there is a 27.76% reduction in the pollution level compared to the other models. Implementing three pollution-controlling strategies, such as pollution cap, pollution cap & trade, and pollution tax, resulted in reductions of 32.52%, 1.72%, and 0.84% in pollution levels, respectively.

We argue that bondholders are fixed claimants who only value firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 CSR performance in relation to firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 risks. We hypothesize that firms with CSR concerns or controversies tend to increase firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 default risk which would adversely affect bondholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 returns. We also argue that CSR investments (CSR strengths) increase the opportunity for residual claimants (i.e., shareholders) to shift the investment risk to the bondholders. Hence, CSR strengths represent higher asset substitution risk or risk-shifting. We argue that bondholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 returns and the stakeholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 interests are aligned when firms have CSR concerns or controversies but their interests are not aligned for CSR strengths since CSR strengths increase asset substitution risk for the bondholders. The alignment and misalignment between bondholders and stakeholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 interests are moderated by bond maturities and are affected by a negative shock in the credit market.

In terms of time, the green-washing behavior of listed firms will increase significantly in the early stage of the implementation of green credit policy, but as time goes by, such green behavior of firms will be detected, which in turn will motivate firms to improve green innovation. Furthermore, the green credit policy has a more significant effect on green innovation of firms in localities under high environmental regulation, economically developed regions, and without other alternative financing channels. Firms located in regions with economically underdeveloped and low environmental regulation are more inclined to adopt the behavior of green-washing environmental information. Besides, after the implementation of the green credit policy, green innovation can improve corporate financial, environmental, and social performance, while green-washing behavior will damage corporate financial, environmental, and social performance.

Its integrated mining technology lies the key security mechanism. The system allows forming a pool mining group to solve a particular job and share their revenues to their CPU usage while one of them successfully mines a block. To mine a block, a cryptographic puzzle should be solved, which requires significant compute resources that cause huge energy consumption. On the other hand, recent statistics show that low computational energy-restricted Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasing exponentially. Although it has low energy and limited computation power, it is large in quantity when it is integrated. So we focus on a stochastic geometry theory, which resolves the issue of block mining computation via utilizing multiple mobile IoT devices, given that these IoT devices are Computation Capable Nodes (CCNs). To further normalize this issue, we propose an efficient mathematical solution that uses smart coordination of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) for IoT devices to enable their CPU usage efficiently. At the same time, the work and credit point distribution policy is smartly handled through virtual pool mining. The proposal renders Network Function Virtualization technology to configure VNF, and Service Function Chain technology is utilized to enable the network flow of such VNFs. New algorithms are presented to solve multiple issues like node discovery, computation offloading, and work credit point distribution. Our goal is to minimize energy consumption within the given time constraint. Implementation results show that although virtual functions for block mining require extensive computations in IoT devices, dividing computation work into small fractions called tasks embedded with VNF, and offloading them to nearby CCNs, tend to minimize the cost and energy consumption of individual shared miners. The overall mining process is proved efficient and faster. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 IEEE.\"\\n\"Zhang Y., Cao S., Lin X., Su Z., Wang K.\",\"Corporate financial decision under green credit guidelines: evidence from China\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130212239&doi=10.1080%2f13547860.2022.2072095&partnerID=40&md5=e5c8b23e655f5e75290015e9311de7b2\",\"Developing green finance is an important measure for China to achieve a win-win situation between economy and ecology.

Employing the financial data of A-share listed enterprises from 2009 to 2015, we find that the implementation of GCG restrains the financing and investment behavior of heavily polluting enterprises. The effects of GCG are influenced by institutional factors, and GCG has a more inhibitory effect in the higher polluting, state-owned, and eastern region registered enterprises. This result reveals the importance of GCG in adjusting financial leverage and promoting environmental protection.

However, the fact is often ignored that many companies are small- and medium-sized enterprises. They do not have enough capital to make green decisions. This paper studies a green supply chain financing system, including a green manufacturer and a capital-constrained retailer and analyzes the effect of credit insurance on financing and product\\'s green level. We consider consumers have a green preference. The retailer can finance through two methods: bank credit financing and trade credit financing. We find the manufacturer\\'s financing preference is closely related to unit production cost and green investment cost coefficient. When the unit production cost is low, and the green investment cost coefficient is high, or the unit production cost is high, and the green investment cost coefficient is in the middle threshold, the manufacturer prefers to actively provide trade credit financing for the capital-constrained retailer. And, in the former case, trade credit financing can also enhance the green level of the supply chain. Finally, we also find that credit insurance can mitigate the default risk of the retailer and help the manufacturer improve profits but cannot improve the product\\'s green level. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\"\\n\"Van Hoa N., Van Hien P., Tiep N.C., Huong N.T.X., Mai T.T.H., Phuong P.T.L.\",\"The Role of Financial Inclusion, Green Investment and Green Credit on Sustainable Economic Development: Evidence from Vietnam\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129282605&doi=10.32826%2fcude.v1i127.600&partnerID=40&md5=7b43dc2f617e9bbd02bcf513d0d8d7cd\",\"Recently, sustainable economic development (SED) has become an international requirement due to the uncertainty of the environment and needs researchers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 attention.

With the development and evolution of efficient wireless data communication and transmission technology, the study combines theoretical and empirical green credit analysis to analyze listed companies in different industries quantitatively. The index system of credit risk assessment is established through wireless data transmission technology combined with mobile computing and machine learning neural networks. A back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model is confirmed by principal component analysis and factor analysis, and the performance of the model is verified with example data. The results show that the BPNN-based credit risk assessment model can provide 95% accuracy. In addition, 99% of the sample companies have low risk and no green credit risk. However, most companies in the coal industry are at greater risk. Overall, medium and high-risk companies accounted for 11.5%.

We use the Global Malmquist- Luenberger index to measure low-carbon total factor productivity using gross regional product as the desired output, CO2 emissions as the undesired output, and capital stock, employment, and total energy consumption as input indicators to represent the low-carbon economic transition. We select seven indicators in four dimensions of green credit, green securities, green insurance, and green investment to construct a comprehensive green finance evaluation system, and then apply the entropy value method to calculate green finance indicators. The number of patents granted for low-carbon innovation is used to measure low-carbon technology innovation. Foreign direct investment, industrialization level, economic development level, and urbanization level are selected as control variables.

Therefore, an increasing number of manufacturers begin to invest in production equipment and technology to produce more environmentally friendly products. However, given the high cost in the investment of green technologies, the development of green supply chain is hindered. In the real world, when it is difficult for manufacturers to complete the production of green products due to capital constraints, apart from the financing by manufacturers to undertake the cost of green investment, some well-funded retailers will also choose to bear the cost of green investment for a greater more motivated to get involved in green technologies, and who bears the cost can further encourage the development of green supply chain. This study considers the vertical market structure of the chain-to-chain competition composed of a manufacturer and a retailer respectively. Suppose that the first supply chain produces traditional products, and the second supply chain produces green products through the way in which the manufacturer or the retailer bears the green investment cost, also known as the manufacturer financing or the retailer financing. Meanwhile, the profit functions for the members of these two supply chains under different financing modes are established. Considering the financing risk, the paper also analyzes and compares the green level of products and the performance of supply chains under the non-financing mode, the manufacturer financing mode and the retailer financing mode. The results reveal that the manufacturer of green supply chain has always been motivated to finance, but the motivation for financing is relatively small. In other words, the manufacturer prefers the financing to be carried out by the retailer with sufficient capital. While only when the customers\\xe2\\x80\\xb2 green preference in the competitive supply chain is less than a threshold, will the retailer be fueled to finance. If the manufacturer is creditworthy, the retailer should face reduced financing risks. Under such circumstances, the retailer is more willing to finance by himself or herself, so as to obtain more profits through the known customer information and demand information. In the case of the retailer financing mode, the green level of products is much higher, which is more beneficial to the improved environmental performance. Based on the above conclusions, we can draw the following three management inspirations. Firstly, in an environment featured by competing with the supply chain that produces traditional products, the production of green products is always conducive to the performance of green supply chain, suggesting that with the enhancement of environmental awareness among customers, producing green products is an effective way to increase the competitiveness of the supply chain. Secondly, the retailer financing mode is better for the performance of both the supply chain and the environment. Thus, the manufacturer should establish a good credit rating, increase the probability of financing for the retailer through cooperation, and strengthen the financing incentives for retailers by reducing the opportunity cost of capital. If the retailer is reluctant to finance, the manufacturer can consider offering certain preferential policies to the retailer, such as price discounts and cost apportionments, to encourage the retailer to finance so as to achieve a win-win situation. Finally, the green preference of customers will increase not only the retailer\\xe2\\x80\\xb2s financing motivation, but also the product\\xe2\\x80\\xb2s green level.

We find that the quality of environmental information disclosure is positively (negatively) related to the scale (cost) of bank financing. Furthermore, the formal institution (proxied by the official issuance of the Green Credit Guidelines) strengthens the above relationship. Moreover, the informal institution (proxied by bank connection) weakens the association between the quality of environmental information disclosure and bank financing. Our results are valid after addressing the potential endogeneity between environmental information disclosure and bank financing and remain unchanged in various robustness tests. Our findings affirm the decision usefulness of corporate environmental information disclosure that can be used by companies as an effective strategy for obtaining bank financing and the ethical integrity of borrowers to banks as an important group of capital market participants. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 The Authors.

Therefore, all countries are struggling to formulate policies for sustainable development. In this context, this study examines the consequences of financial development, and some controlled variables such as economic growth, energy consumption, and urbanization on the overall environmental performance of five developing ASEAN economies, namely Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines over the period of 2003\\xe2\\x80\\x932016. This study employs the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) constructed by Yale University for environmental performance instead of CO2 emissions, a single variable for environmental conditions. This study uses fixed effect, random effect, Newey West, and generalized least square estimators for empirical analysis. The empirical findings divulge that financial development positively affects the environmental performance of these countries. Nonetheless, energy usage and urbanization have a negative relationship with the EPI of these countries Moreover; findings show confirms the validity of the EKC hypothesis in these countries. The study suggests that policymakers of these countries should provide credit for the environment-friendly, energy-efficient, and green projects. Additionally, policies should be designed for sustainable economic development that encourages the use of renewable energy. In addition, renewable energies should be subsidized instead of fossil fuel-based energies. \\xc2\\xa9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.\"\\n\"Liu Z., Vu T.L., Phan T.T.H., Ngo T.Q., Anh N.H.V., Putra A.R.S.\",\"Financial inclusion and green economic performance for energy efficiency finance\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125911086&doi=10.1007%2fs10644-022-09393-5&partnerID=40&md5=8fe32a0dba1d169467d32dbad40a7747\",\"Financial inclusion is fundamental for increasing the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance and green economy has emerged as one of the dominant factors to ecological sustainability, but how will these two factors connect?

By taking into account the fast-expanding technology banking system, as well as the application of the minimum distance to the weak efficient frontier framework (MinDw), a comprehensive assessment of financial inclusion is created, as is an assessment of green economic productivity. The findings show that the expansion of financial inclusion may contribute to increased green economic proficiency, which is primarily achieved via the tightening of credit restrictions on carbon emitting companies.

This is increasingly recognised as a contribution to both the environmental and the financial sustainability of the organisation. However, the implications of VEGB beyond its original environmental domain largely remain underspecified, thus constraining the theoretical development of the field and advocacy for organisations in practice. This study thus investigates how VEGB associates with the employee outcome of affective commitment, which especially impacts the psychological relationships that employees develop with their organisations. Drawing on two studies, we found that VEGB was positively associated with affective commitment, as enabled by three mediating mechanisms that enhanced the sense of warm glow and moral credit for employees while protecting them against emotional exhaustion. Moreover, we found that perceived organisational support for the environment served as a boundary condition for VEGB and its mediation by moral credit and emotional exhaustion. Implications for theory and practice are discussed in the paper. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 The Authors.

The extensive use of renewable energy and green finance is considered as the solution to this dramatic issue, especially in the Covid-19 lockdown. To answer this demand, the present study examines the impact of green financial development such as green credit, green investment, and green securities along with corporate social responsibility (CSR) in reporting renewable energy investment based on evidence from an emerging economy. Economic growth was used as the control variable of the study. The data was gathered from the central bank and World Development Indicators (WDI) from 1976 to 2020. The error correction model (ECM) was used to test the nexus among the variables. The findings revealed that green credit, green investment, and green securities along with CSR reporting and economic growth have a significant positive nexus with renewable energy investment in the selected emerging economy. These outcomes are helpful for new arrivals to investigate this area in the future along with regulators who want to formulate policies related to green finance and renewable energy usage and investment in the context of emerging and developing countries. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 The Author(s).

Cost-benefit and sensitivity analysis approaches were carried out for the three hydrogen projects in Guangdong province (two cases) and Jiang Xi province (one case). The hydrogen projects are more sensitive to borrowing interest rates and income tax rates, amongst other financing costs. The main reasons are the capital-intensive nature of green energy projects and the role of tax in the rate of return of green projects in the long term. The optimal weight of bank loans for the studied hydrogen projects in China was calculated at nearly 56%, meaning the weight of green bonds is approximately 44%. In other words, diversifying financing channels instead of just relying on bank loans is recommended to reduce the financing risk and capital cost. As a major policy implication, we recommended various de-risking tools, such as the green credit guarantee corporation, to attract private investments in hydrogen projects. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC\"\\n\"Xie Q., Zhang Y., Chen L.\",\"Does green credit policy promote innovation: A case of China\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124524482&doi=10.1002%2fmde.3556&partnerID=40&md5=5382462ae08d79383c353a243afc45f4\",\"This paper constructs a quasi-natural experiment based on the implementation of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreen Credit Guidelines\\xe2\\x80\\x9d policy in 2012 in China and analyzes the impact of the green credit policy on enterprises\\' innovation.

One of the main pillars in the UAE green agenda 2015\\xe2\\x80\\x932030 is the green finance that has been growing in high acceleration in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and the whole world. Consequently, the main objective of this study is to investigate in the financial risks that associated with green lending and whether an increasing in green lending will decrease the non-performing loans ratio (NPLR) of UAE banks, based on the period 2015\\xe2\\x80\\x932020 dataset of 23 UAE\\xe2\\x80\\x99s banks. To achieve this objective, we have used a regression technique that includes a two-stage least square regression analysis and random-effect regression analysis to test if the increase in green credit ratio can reduce the NPL ratio in a sample of UAE\\xe2\\x80\\x99s banks. The current study can be considered the first empirical attempt that conducted on the banking sector in UAE, to discover the variables that might have a direct impact on the NPL ratio. The results reveal that the ratio of green loans has a negative impact on the NPL ratio, as much as the return of equity, while the quality of credit, inefficiency, and the bank size have a positive impact on NPL ratio. But as was not as expected, we found that the impact of solvency ratio has a negative significant on the NPL ratio.

The nutrition security and dietary diversity are even more critical for women of reproductive age among smallholders. This study examined household food insecurity and dietary diversity of women of reproductive age in the rural areas of northwest Bangladesh. Using cross-sectional data collected from 252 smallholder households, we measured household food insecurity and dietary diversity of women of reproductive age by the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale and the Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women, respectively. Determinants of household food insecurity were examined, and associations between household food insecurity and low dietary diversity were determined. The majority of the households were mildly insecure (51.2%) followed by moderately insecure (27.4%). The households felt anxiety of food insecurity for more than six months a year (Food Security Index\\xc2\\xa0= 2.10 out of 4.00). The mean food group consumed by women was 4.63 indicating low dietary diversity and dominance of diets by grains and dark green leafy vegetables. The findings also indicate a significant and positive association between household food insecurity and low dietary diversity of women. Education of household heads, household size, access to information sources, access to credit support, and perceived impacts of climate change on crop production were identified as determinants of household food insecurity. The study recommends that appropriate interventions be formulated to improve the food and nutrition security in the study areas. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\"\\n\"Cresson Wood B.C., Nusz H.\",\"Directors & Officers: just because they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t perform technical or operational work, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t personally involved\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122852939&doi=10.1080%2f07366981.2021.2024787&partnerID=40&md5=dfe3a4ce7b2ed7abee2e28b2499328dd\",\"In spite of the fact that modern information security and privacy attacks are now reaching epic proportions, and also gravely damaging both business and government, there remains a widespread misconception amongst the ranks of directors and officers. That misconception holds that they\\xe2\\x80\\x93the directors and officers\\xe2\\x80\\x93don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to personally get involved in this vitally important area. The truth is that just because they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do hands-on technical or operational work, that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t required to play a critically important role addressing these issues. Their required participation is clearly and irrefutably in evidence in authoritative legal sources such as laws, regulations, court opinions, settlement agreements, etc. The hands-off attitude, this distance from the urgency and difficulty of dealing with the problems, has unfortunately had many serious and damaging consequences. For example, the directors and officers at Equifax recently settled a breach-related lawsuit with plaintiff lawyers, to the tune of $149 million (2020, See In Re Equifax Inc. Securities Litigation, U.S. Dist. Ct. (N. Dist. Georgia, 2020), Consolidated Case No. 1:17-cv-03463-TWT). That lawsuit was based on an Equifax 2017 breach where the credit reports of some 143 million customers were disclosed to unauthorized parties. Before that, the directors and officers at Yahoo! settled a shareholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 derivative action to the tune of $29 million (2019, For specifics, see In re Yahoo! Inc. Customer Data Sec.

The latter lawsuit was based on several breaches at Yahoo! between 2013 and 2016 involving the release of sensitive user information, and then concealment from investors of the facts about those breaches. These and other recent cases make it clear what the scope of the role, for directors and officers, is now being illuminated. To be specific, their role is in fact now sufficiently clear and documented that it can be used as a reference point in various tasks, such as independent audits that green-light certain high-risk transactions. This reference point can also be used for a number of critical governmental actions, such as annually approving the actions taken by corporate senior management in response to a consent decree. Illustrating the contours of this new role, this article provides a brief overview of the minimum legal obligations of corporate directors and officers when it comes to information security and privacy. \\xc2\\xa9 Copyright 2022 Taylor & Francis\\xe2\\x80\\x93All rights reserved.\"\\n\"Dell\\'Atti S., Di Tommaso C., Pacelli V.\",\"Sovereign green bond and country value and risk: Evidence from European Union countries\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122830636&doi=10.1111%2fjifm.12155&partnerID=40&md5=63207d5c955f54fb803069679d94e3fc\",\"The sovereign green bond market has been growing rapidly worldwide since its debut in 2016.

First, a higher propensity to green lending is associated with lower profitability, more moderate default risk, and lower credit risk than banks with a less green investment approach. Second, more collateralization and duration of green lending increase bank performance, while the larger syndicate size reduces profitability and risk.

However, along with that, reserve cost allocation mechanisms (RCAMs) ignoring RPS obligations are no longer cooperative, since GP penetration and market reserve demands are partially determined by RPS obligations now. Thus, an innovative RCAM, dominated by both net loads and RPS obligations through reserve costs contribution rate (RCCR) is proposed. A tri-level model is formulated to evaluate modifications and the proposed RCAM. On the first level, RCCR is achieved by calculating the incremental ratio of system reserve costs from level-1 without RPS constraint to level-3 with RPS constraint. The lower two levels form a classic bi-level model, where energy users interact with the independent system operator by strategical investment in distributed energy resources. Case studies based on the IEEE 6- and 118-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RCAM. \\xc2\\xa9 2010-2012 IEEE.\"\\n\"M\\xc3\\xa9sonnier J.-S.\",\"Banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 climate commitments and credit to carbon-intensive industries: new evidence for France\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121515245&doi=10.1080%2f14693062.2021.2012121&partnerID=40&md5=7651380f250f1de183f3d965efb603ca\",\"I investigate whether and how banks align green words, in terms of their commitments to tackle climate change, with deeds in terms of credit allocation across carbon-intensive industries in France.

I find evidence that higher levels of self-reported climate commitments by banks are associated with a slower growth of lending to large firms in the five most carbon-intensive industries. However, lending to small and medium-sized enterprises across more or less carbon-intensive industries remains unrelated to banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 commitments to green their business. These findings suggest that devising an appropriate carbon reporting framework for small firms is likely to enhance the decarbonization of bank lending. Key policy insights Over 2010\\xe2\\x80\\x932017, in France, banking groups that self-report to CDP as being more committed to climate change adaptation and mitigation tend to cut their lending relatively faster to domestic firms in the five most carbon-intensive industries. This pattern is entirely driven by the dynamics of banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 credit to large corporations, which in France are legally bound to regular carbon reporting. In contrast, banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 climate commitments do not seem to affect their lending to domestic small and medium-sized enterprises(SMEs) in carbon-intensive industries. Overall, the results support recent calls for an extension of mandatory carbon disclosure regulations to SMEs. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\"\\n\"Park S., Yoo S.H.\",\"Government intervention in environmental performance considering working capital issues: Control the supplier or the buyer?\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120832172&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2021.107790&partnerID=40&md5=845e7150d0312df1a32ef40008cb49e5\",\"We investigate government intervention in the supply chains\\xe2\\x80\\x99 environmental performance considering trade credit and working capital issues.

The analytical investigations and numerical analyses show that government interventions (direct and indirect) always outperform no intervention in terms of environmental performance, market performance, consumer surplus, and social welfare. Also, direct and indirect government interventions contribute identically to performance improvements. However, direct intervention in the supplier induces the buyer\\'s payment term extension, while indirect intervention through the buyer shortens the payment term. Therefore, the interaction between the government\\'s and the buyer\\'s decisions determines each player\\'s profit performance depending on the government\\'s choice of assessment standard for environmental performance.

However, the current way it is operationalized, makes it more complex to implement. Access to the required information is an important barrier. There are also risks, when tracking back the carbon footprint of consumed products, of missing greenhouse emitted during their production. Indeed, the Eulerian specification of the flow of embodied GHG emissions in and out of a city cannot capture the history of the carbon embodied. To address these issues, we propose a new GHG accounting system for city, replacing the Eulerian specification with a Lagrangian specification, thus permitting to leverage the advantages of both CBA and PBA. We call it a Lagrangian CBA. Instead of focusing on the city, it follows the products and their embodied GHG emissions through time and space, from city to city, along their value chain or value circle. It can then keep track of their trajectory and their history. DLT is used to serve the Lagrangian description of the flow of GHG emissions embodied in products. With its immutability function, information related to each transaction of products is cryptographically sealed and recorded on distributed ledgers, with a time stamp and cannot be changed without the DLT network consensus. The smart contract function authorizes the transfer of responsibility for GHG emissions embodied in a product from its producer to its buyer alongside the transfer of the product. This provides a much higher level of granularity to the GHG accounting system, with possibility of getting detailed descriptions attached to the GHG emissions footprint of products. For each ton of GHG emissions embodied in a consumed product, it is possible to know precisely from where, in the value chains, it has been emitted as well as other relevant information. The use of digitized methodologies, IoT, AI, GPS, RFID will further automatize the GHG accounting system. The way the baseline is set is another specificity of the GHG accounting system proposed. It departs from the current baseline framework and proposes a new type of baseline we call forward-looking baseline. This type of baseline brings out what is needed instead of (i) what is possible or desirable or (ii) what progress has been already achieved. It indicates at any point in time to cities and their climate actors, where they should be in terms of climate performance, to be aligned with the climate goals. A framework foreseen to assign to cities accountability for GHG emissions or to credit cities for GHG emission reductions should be able to do it based on responsibilities and effort. However, a consumption-based approach for city GHG accounting, which depends on responsibilities and effort is challenging to develop. Indeed, (i) GHG emission reductions of cities can arise from a chain of climate actions, (ii) several drivers could be at the origin of an impact on city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GHG emission and (iii) for important types of climate actions, there is no direct causal link between the action of a city and the impact on its GHG emissions. A ToC, using a matrix for system analysis, establishing the linkages between the actions of a city as change agent, and the impact it is claiming, is proposed to address these challenges. It also enables the ex-ante determination of the climate contribution of a city action plan, useful for many reasons: It establishes the link between the actions that are to be introduced in a city action plan and the impact that is expected. Impact cannot be claimed without action;It enables city government to prioritize the city action plan that addresses the development needs of the city while being aligned with the climate goals;It enables a city to join a Local Government Green Funding Agency (LGGFA) which has as criteria for participation, forward-looking green activities in a green city action plan;Determining the emissions of future actions in a city action plan enables influential stakeholders such as central government, financiers and citizens that are constituencies, to proactively encourage greener greenfield and renovation plans;In case a city issues a green bond for the implementation of its city action plan, the ex-ante determination of the impact of the city action plan may be required. In most of the papers, addressing the topic of categorization of consumption-based GHG emissions, a sector-based approach to categorization is used. An approach to categorization of consumption-based GHG emissions that depends on need is proposed. It builds the consumption categories around the core basic needs citizens must satisfy. \\xc2\\xa9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\"\\n\"Bajaj V., Kumar P., Singh V.K.\",\"Linkage dynamics of sovereign credit risk and financial markets: A bibliometric analysis\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118281238&doi=10.1016%2fj.ribaf.2021.101566&partnerID=40&md5=46d4f140c0e8013f57d1a89ab2611ca1\",\"The manuscript aims to perform a study on the evolution of academic literature revolving around the linkages between sovereign credit risk and financial markets through a comprehensive bibliometric perspective.

However, different motives associated with environmental information disclosure have different influences on the financing of companies. This paper adopts renewable energy companies instead of high pollution industries as a research object. The study analyzes the resource-dependent disclosure motivation of renewable energy companies, and the impact of environmental information disclosure on the scale and cost of direct and indirect financing. The results show the following. First, renewable energy companies in China have a resource-dependent motivation to disclose environmental information, with a gap between the level of environmental information disclosure and their actual environmental performance. Second, renewable energy companies may obtain more direct financing amount and lower indirect financing costs, but cannot obtain lower direct financing costs and more indirect financing amount by improving the level of environmental information disclosure with the resource-dependent motivation. Third, there are differences in the specific incentives for environmental information disclosure among the Eastern, Middle, and Western regions of China. The government needs to standardize the detailed rules and standards of the corporate environmental information disclosure system, and improve the environmental protection awareness and the implementation of green credit in the Western region. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Li W., Cui G., Zheng M.\",\"Does green credit policy affect corporate debt financing?

The article first reviews the current status of green credit research and theories related to green development in China and other countries and then analyzes the dynamics of green credit development and value creation, as well as the mechanisms by which green credit improves the financial performance of listed banks. Finally, the article explores the impact of green credit on the financial performance of listed banks through empirical analysis. Through a panel data model, this paper analyzes data related to 19 listed banks in China from 2008 to 2017 to investigate the impact of green credit on the financial performance of listed banks. This study has shown that the green credit ratio, as an indicator of the amount of green credit implemented by listed banks, will positively impact financial performance. But the impact of the current period and the one-period lag is more significant, while the effect of the two-period lag is not significant. The second major finding was that when green reputation is used as an indicator to measure the quality of green credit implementation of listed banks, listed banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 financial performance can be significantly improved.

The results reveal that the green credit policy has significantly reduced the short-term and long-term debt financing of heavily polluting enterprises; however, the restrictions on short-term debt financing are insufficient. At the same time, the decline in operating performance brings financial penalty effects, among which state-owned, large-scale, and heavily polluting enterprises in high-emission areas have strong financial penalty effects. The green credit policy encourages heavy-polluting companies to increase R&D investment and increase fixed assets investments to obtain long-term credit support with short-term investment. Furthermore, it is found that the green credit policies have significantly restrained the scale of debt financing of heavily polluting companies. The Chinese government should formulate green financial policies based on local conditions and provide credit resources to favor environmentally friendly companies. Financial institutions should strictly implement green credit standards and modify financial products and services. Companies should take the initiative to eliminate outdated production capacity to obtain green credit support. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\"\\n\"Giunti A., Otto F.\",\"Erratum to: On the existence of the Green function for elliptic systems in divergence form (manuscripta mathematica, (2022), 167, 1-2, (385-402), 10.1007/s00229-021-01271-0)\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110865048&doi=10.1007%2fs00229-021-01325-3&partnerID=40&md5=a5c46084904a24dd37dcc2a0389afd57\",\"The article On the existence of the Green function for elliptic systems in divergence form, written by Arianna Giunti, Felix Otto, was originally published Online First without Open Access.

Despite the fact that profitability and sustainability are inorganically linked to financial institutions, sustainable lending has been a constant focus of attention. Due to regulatory pressure and stakeholder concerns, financial institutions are forced to implement a variety of sustainable measures; they are also gradually thinking to give more support to socially impactful and sustainable projects. Financial institutions can play a major role in establishing sustainable development by adopting the green lending policy. However, there have been few studies on sustainability credit score systems (SCSS) that take into account social and environmental factors. To fill the gaps of existing literature, this study proposes a multi-criteria SCSS that takes into account the environment and social aspects in addition to financial and managerial aspects. A combined Best-Worst Method (BWM) and the fuzzy-Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method are used in this study to create a credit scoring system. The BWM is used to determine the weight of factors, and the fuzzy-TOPSIS is used to evaluate applicants. The ambiguity while evaluating borrowers has been captured by applying fuzzy set theory. A real-life case study is used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model. The model is unique in terms of the number of social and environmental factors considered. This research will assist financial institutions in identifying borrowers who engage in sustainable business practices. Borrowers can be holistically prioritised by applying the model. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\"\\n\"Lin B., Bai R.\",\"Machine learning approaches for explaining determinants of the debt financing in heavy-polluting enterprises\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106981032&doi=10.1016%2fj.frl.2021.102094&partnerID=40&md5=6f56b0ae78c30fb99750fc346a5eefbe\",\"Under the background of green credit policy, more and more attention has been paid to the debt financing of high-polluting enterprises.

Due to political irregularities, international human rights concerns, and tensions with its neighbors, Burundi has been increasingly isolated from international markets. This isolation, combined with poor households more limited access to credit, means that agricultural development actors must consider different approaches to improving agricultural production and household food security. One such initiative, known as the Crop Livestock Integration Project (CLiP), focused on crop-livestock integration and intensification using locally available and affordable resources. An assessment conducted by the author in late 2016 suggests that CLiP was promoting an agroecological model of pro-poor, Boserupian intensification that makes sense in a place like Burundi. While this innovation was occurring under very challenging political economic circumstances in Burundi, and was contested within the International Crop Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) hierarchy, it may serve as a model for promoting resilience and food security at the community level in a variety of contexts. This case is also an interesting example of how agricultural development approaches are often co-produced as their conception and implementation are modified across multiple scales, and how agricultural development knowledge is contested or subverted within an international development institution. \\xc2\\xa9 2021\"\\n\"Wu Z., Cai X., Li M., Hu L.\",\"Optimal mixed charging schemes for traffic congestion management with subsidy to new energy vehicle users\",2022,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090122460&doi=10.1111%2fitor.12869&partnerID=40&md5=6aa6d6ac3b49910a3d164caee70c8835\",\"Traffic congestion and emissions are two severe and urgent problems in the transportation field.

Green technology innovation is the transmission path through which digital finance affects energy-environmental performance. The impact mechanism test proves that digital finance affects pure technical efficiency rather than scale efficiency.

In this lieu, an economic optimization framework for the Australian ammonia supply chain is presented. The model seeks to address the economic potential of distributed ammonia plants across Australia. Different techniques for hydrogen and related ammonia production such as thermal plasma, nonthermal plasma, and electrolysis (all typifying technology disruption), and mini Haber-Bosch (typifying scale disruption) are benchmarked to the central mega plant on a world-scale using conventional technology, verifying that \"\"Moore\\'s Law\"\"(Mack, C. A. IEEE Trans. 2011, 24 (2), 202-207) of growing bigger and bigger is not the only path to sustainable agriculture. Results show that ammonia can be produced at $317/ton at a regional scale using thermal plasma hydrogen generation which could be competitive to the conventional production model, if credit in terms of lead time and carbon footprint could be taken into account. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 American Chemical Society.\"\\n\"Jiang L.\",\"Research on low carbon financial support strategies from the perspective of eco-environmental protection\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124021553&doi=10.2478%2feces-2021-0035&partnerID=40&md5=f31865a4bd8be0823ed9dc5a89433a76\",\"This paper provides an in-depth analysis and research on low carbon financial support strategies from the perspective of ecological environmental protection. The understanding and analysis of the development status of ecological environmental protection inspectors, the analysis of the current rule of law construction, organizational structure, operation mechanism and capacity of the current ecological environmental protection inspectors, the understanding of the defects and problems in the work of the inspectors, to provide a basis for improving the inspection function. Through financial instruments It is of great theoretical value and practical significance to realise the full utilization of resources, the optimization of industrial structure and the low-carbon cycle development of agricultural economy. Combining the current situation and constraints of financial support for low-carbon agriculture, we propose targeted financial policy recommendations such as credit innovation for agricultural green projects rich in characteristics and conducive to the development of low-carbon agriculture, broadening private financing channels for low-carbon agriculture, and exploring low-carbon agricultural insurance. The entropy value method is used to determine the index weights, and the comprehensive evaluation method is used to calculate the comprehensive development evaluation value of the two subsystems; finally, the coupling coordination degree model is used to analyse the coupling degree and coupling coordination degree of the carbon finance and low-carbon agriculture composite systems, and the factors affecting the coupling coordination degree are analysed on this basis. Although the coupling level between them is at a low level of coupling, it is in transition to a medium coupling; the coupling coordination degree is at a mild disorder, and gradually in transition to a near disorder. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Lihong Jiang, published by Sciendo.\"\\n\"Wang M., Li L., Dai Q., Shi F.\",\"Resource Allocation Based on DEA and Non-Cooperative Game\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122453822&doi=10.1007%2fs11424-021-0259-1&partnerID=40&md5=3518d825c1a0642546de22d77d82801a\",\"Resource allocation is one of the most important applications of data envelopment analysis (DEA). Usually, the resource to be allocated is directly related to the interests of decision-making units (DMUs), thus the dynamic non-cooperative game is one of the representative behaviours in the allocation process. However, it is rarely considered in the previous DEA-based allocation studies, which may reduce the acceptability of the allocation plan. Therefore, this paper proposes a DEA-based resource allocation method considering the dynamic non-cooperative game behaviours of DMUs. The authors first deduce the efficient allocation set under the framework of variable return to scale (VRS) and build the allocation model subjecting to the allocation set. Then an iteration algorithm based on the concept of the non-cooperative game is provided for generating the optimal allocation plan. Several interesting characteristics of the algorithm are proved, including i) the algorithm is convergent, ii) the optimal allocation plan is a unique Nash equilibrium point, and iii) the optimal allocation plan is unique no matter which positive value the initial allocation takes. Some advantages of the allocation plan have been found. For example, the allocation plan is more balanced, has more incentives and less outliers, compared with other DEA-based allocation plans. Finally, the proposed method is applied to allocate the green credit among the 30 Chinese iron and steel enterprises, and the results highlight the applicability of the allocation method and solution approach. Therefore, the approach can provide decision makers with a useful resource allocation tool from the perspective of dynamic non-cooperative game. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, The Editorial Office of JSSC & Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.\"\\n\"Ji L., Jia P., Yan J.\",\"Green credit, environmental protection investment and debt financing for heavily polluting enterprises\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122063213&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0261311&partnerID=40&md5=277c7e6ed3f1ffaa207c6db9a3b0dca9\",\"The paper takes listed companies in the heavily polluting industry from 2009\\xe2\\x80\\x932017 as a research sample to explore whether heavy pollution enterprises\\xe2\\x80\\x99 environmental protection investment helps their debt financing under the institutional background of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s continuous implementation of green credit policy.

Here, we used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design to test an hypothesis that enhancing dopamine levels boosts the guidance of MF credit assignment by MB inference. In line with this, we found that levodopa enhanced guidance of MF credit assignment by MB inference, without impacting MF and MB influences directly. This drug effect correlated negatively with a dopaminedependent change in purely MB credit assignment, possibly reflecting a trade-off between these two MB components of behavioural control.

Firstly, this paper selects the time series data of green credit at the national level from 2013 to 2019 according to the official statistics and evaluates the coupling and coordinated development of credit system and environmental system based on the coupling coordination model. The results show that the two systems show well\\xe2\\x80\\x90coordinated development, but the interaction has annual fluctuations. Secondly, by calculating the provincial carbon emissions and green credit panel data from 2005 to 2019, the dynamic internal mechanism is analysed based on Panel Vector Autoregression (PVAR) model. It is found that green credit has a significant inhibitory effect on carbon emissions. The research results of this paper provide an overall evaluation of the quantity and quality of green credit for China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s banking industry.

Among the major export-earning crops in Myanmar, mung bean is one of the important, and it creates many opportunities for smallholders. About 90% of the total production of mung bean is exported for overseas or border trade and has extended markets, especially China, Vietnam and EU countries. This study aims to measure the level of technical efficiency of green mung bean producers and determine the factors influencing the technical efficiency of mung bean production in Tatkon Township, Myanmar. Data from 144 farms were analyzed using a DEA model and Tobit regression. The empirical results reveal that about 46% of farmers had an efficiency score of more than 0.90, which indicates that 54% of farmers were relatively inefficient in their production. The results also show that socioeconomics factors, such as age of farmers, farmers participating in associations and soil fertility, had a significantly positive impact on technical efficiency. Gender, education, access to credit and extension services had a positive impact on the technical efficiency of mung bean production in the study area. To reduce inefficiency, the government should consider providing more services to male farmers and older farmers to improve their capacities, as well as providing an extension of services, new technologies, credit and improved variety for mung bean production. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 by the authors.

We select the relevant input-output data to measure the green total factor productivity (GTFP) and its decomposition index including undesirable output. The results show that the GTFP and its decomposition index in the YRD have a slow fluctuating upward trend. The YRD mainly depends on improving the level of technological progress and environmental governance to promote the improvement of regional economic green development level. The empirical research results show that there is an inverted U relationship between environmental regulation and GTFP in the YRD, too strict environmental regulation will inhibit the growth of green total factor productivity. By adding control variables, the inflection point of environmental regulation is 0.5034, which is lower than that without control variables. There is a strong interaction and superposition effect between financial development and environmental regulation, which is closely related to the established financial cooperation mechanism, perfect financial system arrangement and cross-regional financial cooperation platform in the YRD. Government intervention should be reduced, the introduction of foreign capital should be controlled appropri-ately, foreign capital should be guided to green industries, and the use efficiency of foreign capital should be improved. This paper holds that we should pay attention to the strength of environmental regulation, prevent overcorrection, increase the guidance of credit funds, deepen the reform of the financial system, appropriately intervene in the market by the government, strengthen the guidance of foreign capital, and promote the development and transformation of the green economy in the YRD region with the help of several policies. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 by the authors.

In addition, the capacity of any warehouse is limited in practice; thus, the retailer needs an additional rented warehouse to store the excess units when the order quantity exceeds the capacity of the own warehouse. Furthermore, with the globalization of the marketing policy, the supplier may provide the retailer a discounted price if the quantity of purchase is large enough. Green inventory management reduces the environmental impacts of a business without lacking its profit. Considering all of the factors mentioned above, in this paper, we study a green economic order quantity model with capacity constraint under order-size-dependent trade credit and all-units discount along with minimizing carbon for a cleaner environment. The paper discusses all the potential cases, which may occur in green inventory models with carbon emission cost under different allowable delay in payments.

The main objective is to determine the sustainable optimal ordering strategies for retailers and decide whether a rented warehouse (RW) is to obtain ordering and replenishment policies for a retailer such that the retailer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual profit is maximized. First, we prove that the conditions of the objective functions have interior minimizer value and the closed-form optimal solution is found. Next, an algorithm is developed to determining the global optimal solution of the problem.

Taking the provincial panel dataset of China as the research sample, this paper investigates the spatial impacts of green credit on the green economy. The super slack-based measure (Sup-SBM) model with undesirable outputs is employed to calculate the level of green economy within China. On this basis, we establish spatial Durbin models to study the impact of green credit on green economy and its transmission mechanisms. The results show that green credit exhibits a local-neighborhood effect on green economy; that is, the green credit can not only improve the local green economy but also generate spatial spillover effect to promote the development of green economy in surrounding areas. The above conclusion still holds after the robustness test by replacing spatial weight matrices and alternative measurement for the explained variable. Furthermore, enhancing innovation efficiency and optimizing energy structure are important ways for green credit to promote green economy. The findings of this study not only provide a new perspective for understanding the economic consequences of green credit policy but also provide empirical evidence for the important role of green finance in achieving the win-win goals of economic growth and environmental protection. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\"\\n\"Liu S., Xu R., Chen X.\",\"Does green credit affect the green innovation performance of high-polluting and energy-intensive enterprises?

In this environment, we incorporate a manufacturer and two rival retailers who compete against one another for selling price and advertisement of a product, where the members offer trade credit facilities to the downstream players. We consider that the manufacturer invests in green technology to curtail the emission during the production and rework process. The retailers provide advertisements to expand their businesses, where market demands are dependent on their selling prices, advertisement frequencies, and the green innovation level. Here, we analyze the model under the cap-and-trade policy for various subcases of the centralized and decentralized systems and discuss a solution algorithm for the optimal results. For the practical feasibility test of the model, numerical analysis is examined, and the impact of variations of the critical parameters is studied. The study\\'s primary motive is to figure out the optimal operative strategies and collaborative actions on the decision variables, which leads to the profits of the supply chain to a lofty extent. We observe that the offered credit periods are highly responsive to the profit functions so that the chain members have to be more careful and draw a compact plan for credit policy. Moreover, the manufacturer has to invest in green technology up to a certain level, as, after that level, high investment costs will hamper the optimal profit. Besides, the retailers must have adequate policies for selling prices and advertisement frequencies to acquire a higher yield. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\"\\n\"Harisankar R., Rakesh P.\",\"Simulation-based comparative study on energy efficiency criteria for LEED and BREEAM systems\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120405783&doi=10.1088%2f1742-6596%2f2070%2f1%2f012222&partnerID=40&md5=076ffd1b8079fb76762e6d3ced1d513f\",\"Energy efficiency is regarded as one of the important elements of green building. Every Green Building Rating (GBR) system puts forward a set of criteria for energy efficiency and it is different for each system. A comparative study is done to distinguish between two GBR systems practiced worldwide- LEED and BREEAM, first on the criteria for energy efficiency and secondly on how efficient and effective each system in energy performance improvement. Building energy simulation tool, eQuest is used to obtain annual energy consumption of a case study multi-family dwelling residential building for its various design options. Different design cases were formulated by changing design parameters and the simulation results thus obtained are used for evaluating the performance improvement for energy, calculated as per the criteria for each system. This study primarily looks for the combinations which grab total achievable credits in energy efficiency for a particular system. For LEED, it was found that renewable energy allocation alone has the greater influence in achieving higher credits. For BREEAM, there requires specifically a considerable decrease in HVAC load which can be brought by the means of more natural ventilation or by adopting passive cooling techniques. BREEAM was also found more effective in reflecting any kind of improvement made in terms of awarding credits. \\xc2\\xa9 Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.\"\\n\"Zhang K., Li Y., Qi Y., Shao S.\",\"Can green credit policy improve environmental quality?

The results show that green credit does improve China\\'s environmental quality overall. Green credit can reduce environmental pollution through three mechanisms: improving enterprise performance, motivating enterprise innovation, and upgrading industrial structure. However, there are regional differences in the emission-reduction effect of green credit. Green credit improves the environmental quality in resource-based regions more than non-resource-based regions; the emission-reduction effect is significant in regions with developed financial markets, but not significant elsewhere.

As part of a wider approach to ensuring sustainable provision, this has prompted a number of carefully formulated water efficiency improvement plans for buildings, one of the highest water-consuming sectors. This paper presents a detailed analysis of water efficiency potential for a multi-storey commercial complex and an office building in central Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a detailed analysis of the water use and efficiency of the water fittings was carried out. Important data such as historical water use and details of water fittings were acquired during a field survey. A series of water flow rate tests were conducted at the selected buildings and each of the water systems was analysed separately, using the criteria of water efficiency stipulated by a locally applied green building tool. A comparison of water consumption before and after the improvement plan was then made. Findings: Findings from the field surveys indicate that only some of the water fittings were certified with recognised efficiency ratings, which suggests a good opportunity for improvement. The proposed replacement of more-efficient fittings could potentially improve the obtainable green credit points by at least 10 from a maximum of 15. A cost\\xe2\\x80\\x93benefit analysis for a water fitting replacement scheme shows that the estimated payback period is less lengthy for the larger commercial building due to the higher potential savings. Practical implications: Strategies for improvements in water efficiency for existing non-residential buildings are provided in this paper. The same water consumption analysis procedure can be used by maintenance engineers and other practitioners in building assessments where water efficiency and sustainability in building operation are of concern. Originality/value: This case study responds to the need for efficient use of freshwater and provides insight into the water efficiency opportunities for commercial buildings. The potential cost savings for replacements of inefficient water fittings have been analysed using a green building tool as a guide. This has not been extensively analysed in previous studies. \\xc2\\xa9 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.\"\\n\"Wu J., Shang J.\",\"Green credit financing equilibrium under government subsidy and supply uncertainty\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120002374&doi=10.3390%2fsu132212917&partnerID=40&md5=3550635193e8833d4884d9cdafc6221d\",\"In this paper, we study the green credit financing equilibrium in a green supply chain (GSC) with government subsidy and supply uncertainty. The GSC system is composed of one manufacturer, two retailers, one bank, and the government. The manufacturer is subject to both supply uncertainty and limited capital. The manufacturer invests in the R&D of green products and borrows loans from the bank. The government subsidizes banks to encourage banks to provide loans to manufacturers with lower interest rates, which is termed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreen credit financing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The two retailers decide their order quantities with horizontal competition or horizontal cooperation. We first developed a Stackelberg model to investigate the green credit financing equilibriums (i.e., the interest rate of the bank, the manufacturer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s product green degree and wholesale price, and the retailers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 order quantity) under horizontal competition and horizontal cooperation, respectively. Subsequently, we analyzed how the subsidy interest rate, supply uncertainty, and supply correlation affect financing decisions regarding equilibrium green credit. We found that a high subsidy interest rate leads to a low interest rate of bank and the manufacturer can set a high level of green product and high wholesale price, while the retailers can set a high order quantity. Finally, we compared the green credit financing equilibriums under horizontal competition with those under horizontal cooperation using numerical and analytical methods. We found that, in general, the optimal decisions and profits of bank and SC members, consumer surplus, and social welfare under horizontal competition are higher than those under horizontal cooperation.

The impacts of green credit policies on agricultural supply chains have rarely been discussed before. Therefore, we focus on the incentive mechanism of green credit policies in the agricultural supply chain. We use the Stackelberg Lead-ership Model to construct a pricing model which adds the interest subsidy and required reserve ratio (RRR) cuts, and determines the pricing rules of bank loans and production decisions of the farmer in the agricultural supply chain under the incentive policy of green credit by quantifying the optimization problems of the bank and the farmer. The result shows that optimal decisions exist for both farmer and bank in the supply chain game framework. The implementation of the green credit policies contributes to both of their profits. Additionally, the green credit policies give the bank room to reduce interest rates so that the overall utility level of the supply chain could be improved. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 by the authors.

The main reason for undertaking this topic is the observed increased interest of domestic banks in green financing of investments on the energy market in Poland. Therefore, the main objective are to explore the determinants of changes in the level and structure of bank loans under the influence of green investments in the energy sector in Poland. The article verifies the research hypothesis which assumes that an increase in financing green investments by bank loans in the energy market in Poland requires strengthening the synergy of responsible financing of sustainable development of the economy. For this purpose, a two-stage concept of the empirical research was adopted. On the first stage, questionnaire surveys were conducted among the largest Polish commercial banks to examine the respondents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 acceptance degree of the concept of sustainable financing and greening the loan portfolio. On the second stage, case studies were analyzed along with the analysis of selected secondary quantitative data. It was proven that commercial banks in Poland increase their commitment to sustainable financing, which is observed in the sectorally progressing process of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreening\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the credit offer. There is also a noticeable change in their approach to social responsibility, especially in the context of the energy market, where financing of traditional, ecologically harmful projects is still dominant. However, this trend is slowly being reversed, towards supporting investments in the area of modern, environmentally-friendly energy solutions. However, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreening\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of loan portfolios in the native banking sector requires a responsible lending policy based on various complex business decisions. Increasing their pro-ecological awareness of financing the economy is only a prerequisite, albeit inadequate, of further energy transformation in Poland. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 by the authors.

At present, China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic transformation is urgent, and green finance is being widely concerned. This paper measured the development level of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s green finance from the perspective of green credit, green securities, green investment, and green insurance. Then, it used a spatial dynamic panel model to empirically test the mechanism of the impact of green finance on carbon emissions with panel data of 30 Chinese provinces from 2005 to 2018. The following can be seen from the results: (1) The development of green finance contributes to carbon emission reduction. (2) The spatial spillover effect of green finance is significant. Specifically, the development of green finance can not only reduce the carbon emissions of the local region but also inhibit that of adjacent areas. (3) The development of green finance indirectly leads to a decrease in carbon emissions by reducing financing constraints and boosting green technology innovation. In order to stimulate the carbon emission reduction effect of green finance to a greater extent, we should further support the development of green finance, reduce the financing constraints of energy-saving and environmental-protection enterprises, and encourage the research and development of green innovative technologies. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 by the authors.

Green finance polices, e.g. carbon pricing, tradable green certificate (TGC) and green credit, can provide low-cost finances and counteract the adverse effects of COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, the generation costs of offshore wind power before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in China are analyzed using the data of 97 offshore wind power projects implemented in the period of 2014\\xe2\\x80\\x932020, and the effect of green finance policy on the generation cost and the project profitability are evaluated. The results show that the average levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of offshore wind power decreased from 0.86 CNY/kWh in 2014 to 0.72 CNY/kWh in 2019, while it increased to 0.79 CNY/kWh in 2020, i.e. 10.85% increase relative to that in 2019. With the average carbon price of 50 CNY/t CO2, the average TGC price of 170 CNY and the green-credit policy being introduced, the average LCOE decreases to 0.76 CNY/kWh, 0.67 CNY/kWh and 0.74 CNY/kWh respectively.

Concepts such as small-world social networks, opinion dissemination, and diffusion of innovation are used to capture dynamic social, spatial, and temporal aspects of green stormwater infrastructure adoption. Demographic information, site constraints, GSI practice type and costs, and financial incentive information are integrated into modeling rules that influence adoption dynamics. A methodology is presented that describes how these concepts have been translated into an agent-based modeling platform that provides the opportunity to explore modeling dynamics and output. Model output confirms the viability of the methodology and produces results that inform future efforts to explore the G-SSA model. Practitioner points: Agent-based modeling (ABM) can evaluate the expected impact of market-based approaches for green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) adoption and O&M services. ABM can simulate years of implementation of GSI program incentives, which vary from stormwater fee reduction to subsidy payments to tradable credits revenues generated. Publicly available demographic data combined with behavioral economic relationships can build models to evaluate how municipalities can meet regulatory goals for urban retrofits using market-based approaches to encourage GSI adoption. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Water Environment Federation\"\\n\"Woo J., Fatima R., Kibert C.J., Newman R.E., Tian Y., Srinivasan R.S.\",\"Applying blockchain technology for building energy performance measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) and the carbon credit market: A review of the literature\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112590223&doi=10.1016%2fj.buildenv.2021.108199&partnerID=40&md5=7bd2edba7580fd857269013eecb7468a\",\"The threats posed by climate change to Earth\\'s ecosystems, human health, and the global economy are self-evident, and the building sector has contributed significantly to the creation of this problem. For two decades, the construction industry has attempted to mitigate its environmental impact by adopting green building strategies. However, due to a lack of a secure and accurate measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) system, lowering the industry\\'s carbon footprint has not been embraced by building owners. The building industry has not been able to participate in the carbon credit markets as well. Several factors are contributing to this failure. The primary issue is the complicated and insecure accounting system for accurately tracking energy consumption and carbon emissions. Although there are several building energy performance (BEP) audit schemes, these programs do not provide a suitable structure for a secure and accurate carbon emission MRV. Some climate action groups have navigated an overview of Blockchain for climate actions, especially in registries and tracking solutions, digital MRV, decentralized environment of clean energies, and climate finance. Moreover, there are several attempts to adopt blockchain MRV systems in the climate action projects, and blockchain carbon credit markets were already in place since Blockchain technology can offer a transparent, reliable, and affordable MRV system. This research walked through the literature of the BEP audit programs, the carbon credit market for the building sector, the possibility of adopting Blockchain technology to a digital BEP MRV. The study found that the digital MRV system, which climate action projects require, can be applied to the building sector with the adoption of Blockchain technology. Next, because a few blockchain carbon credit markets are already running, a blockchain digital MRV system needs to be developed to help the building sector participate in the carbon credit markets. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Wellalage N.H., Kumar V.\",\"Environmental performance and bank lending: Evidence from unlisted firms\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105195674&doi=10.1002%2fbse.2804&partnerID=40&md5=c4363142d5066a080f08b9e5545002db\",\"Growing public concerns about sustainability and adopting environmentally responsible practices increase risks as well as opportunities for firms and banks. It is unclear whether being environmentally responsible matters for unlisted firms, which are significant contributors to the degradation of the environment but which are not under strict scrutiny like public listed firms. Using a sample of 3915 firms from developing economies, we investigate whether the superior environmental performance of unlisted firms leads them to better loan conditions. After controlling for endogeneity and sample selection bias, we find that firms with better environmental performance received approximately 6.4% higher loans (as a ratio of total sales) and that this effect is more prominent in small and medium firms. This finding supports an information asymmetry view of agency costs. Our results, however, show that environmental performance does not affect loan duration and collateral requirement, indicating no spillover economic effect of corporate environmental performance on loan conditions.

The indicators ratios are all greater than 1, showing an overall growth trend, with an average annual growth rate of 2.64%. However, the supply-side reform of Shaanxi Province showed a big difference in terms of technological progress, which was only 0.953 in 2016. What\\'s more, the growth of the efficiency of technological progress shows a tortuous growth trend. The largest growth value appeared in 2017, reaching 1.081, and in 2020 it was 1.049. This shows that there is still room for improvement in Shaanxi\\'s supply-side reform. At the same time, in order to more accurately describe the impact of green finance on green total factor productivity, this paper constructed two indicators including financing and investment of green gold, and used the GMM panel model to verify the correlation between the two. The regression coefficients of the green financing scale and the green investment scale to green total factor productivity in Shaanxi Province are 0.56866 (significant level of 5%) and 0.21781 (significant level of 1%), which indicates that the expansion of green financial credit scale and investment scale can directly promotes the improvement of Shaanxi\\'s green total factor productivity. The increase in the scale of green credit has a more important impact on the supply-side reform. This also reflects that the overall efficiency of Shaanxi\\'s green investment is not high enough.

Recently, several concerns have been raised about the lighting environment of heritage buildings that have been adaptively reused for a different function. These changes may lead to a problem for the occupants of the building, particularly on the indoor lighting quality. It is regarded as one of the most affected variables in the building of heritage that is adaptively reused. Green Building Council Indonesia (GBCI) has been concerned about this issue, particularly to the requirements related to lighting power density and control, visual comfort, outside view, and daylight. The purpose of this research is therefore to suggest some strategies for improving the quality of lighting in the two classrooms of two heritage schools in Surabaya, Indonesia, based on the Greenship Interior Space rating tool. There are three credits for lighting power density and control, and one credit for visual comfort criteria. By performing light mapping measurements, calculations, and computer simulation, this analysis is qualitative. To capture the condition of the classrooms examined, building observation was also performed. The observation shows that the existing condition gains four credits only. If adopted, the strategies proposed could achieve eight credits, which is covers 80% of the assessment points. The higher credits achieved reflect a better lighting environment and better value for energy efficiency and conservation. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, Pakistan Academy of Sciences.

The planning areas encompass about 1000 km2 and represent diverse fire regimes and Mediterranean forest ecosystems. We first modeled the burn probability assuming extreme weather conditions and historical fire ignition patterns. Stand-level wildfire exposure was then coupled with fuel consumption estimates to assess expected carbon emissions. Finally, we estimated treatment cost-efficiency and carbon credits for each fuel management plan. Landscape-scale average emissions ranged between 0.003 and 0.070 T CO2 year\\xe2\\x88\\x921 ha\\xe2\\x88\\x921 . Fuel treatments in high emission hotspots attained reductions beyond 0.06 T CO2 year\\xe2\\x88\\x921 per treated ha.

We discuss how stand conditions, fire regimes, and treatment costs determine the treatment cost-efficiency and long-term carbon-sink capacity. Our work may serve as a preliminary step for developing a carbon-credit market and subsidizing wildfire risk management programs in low-revenue Mediterranean forest systems prone to extreme wildfires. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 by the authors.

Under pressure to reduce their energy-related carbon emissions to zero, water utilities have devised a variety of energy management strategies, including the purchase of renewable energy and self-generation of electricity using locally installed renewables. These strategies will incur different costs for the utility, whilst some may have implications for the reliability of water supply systems. Yet the trade-offs between costs, water security and energy sustainability remain unexplored. Here, we present a regional scale analysis to test competing energy strategies, mapping pathways to zero carbon energy and water security. Results from a case-study of the London water system show a balanced approach that allows for some energy self-generation, using biogas, solar and wind, while also purchasing green energy credits from the electricity supply grid can best navigate this trade-off. Balanced investment plans can accommodate energy-intensive water supply techniques such as long-distance transfers, desalination and effluent reuse while meeting energy targets. By becoming energy generators and also adopting more flexible arrangements for energy use, water utilities could become significant players in energy markets. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 The Author(s).

Specifically, this research examines (1) the effect of individual characteristics (i.e., green knowledge, innovativeness) on attitude toward green credit card services; and (2) the mediating role of self-accountability and the moderating role of regulatory focus in the relationships. With a sample of 1000 green credit/debit card users, structural equation modelling and moderated mediation analyses were implemented to investigate the relationships involving green knowledge, innovativeness, self-accountability, regulatory focus, and attitude. The results indicate that (1) while the effect of green knowledge on attitude is not significant, innovativeness has a positive impact on attitude; (2) self-accountability mediates the relationship between (a) green knowledge and (b) innovativeness and attitude; and (3) regulatory focus moderates the relationship between self-accountability and attitude, such that the positive relationship is stronger for consumers with a prevention (vs. promotion) focus. Furthermore, moderated mediation was observed; that is, the mediation effects of self-accountability on the relationship between (a) green knowledge and (b) innovativeness and attitude are stronger for prevention-(vs. promotion-) focused consumers.

The cost of biomass production was found ranging from $ 0.39 to $ 0.92/kg with minimum for the anaerobically digested domestic effluent and centrate. The cost of wastewater treatment was found ranging from 0.18 to 1.69/m3 with minimum for the sewage. These costs did not include any credits generated from the biomass or the treated wastewater. The concentration of limiting nutrient, flowrate of wastewater, and the extent of nutrient removal are the major cost-influencing parameters for the integrated process. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.\"\\n\"Hickey C., O\\'Brien J., Caldecott B., McInerney C., \\xc3\\x93 Gallach\\xc3\\xb3ir B.\",\"Can European electric utilities manage asset impairments arising from net zero carbon targets?\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113770372&doi=10.1016%2fj.jcorpfin.2021.102075&partnerID=40&md5=94cd38455374201678ced88c9f6b274d\",\"This paper develops a framework to assess the ability of electric utilities to sustain the forced impairment of carbon emitting power plants and applies it to the European market.

Based on the compliances of set parameters as defined by green rating systems, a building is certified as green-rated with a certain level of certification. However, even after strict compliances of rating systems a large quantum of construction waste still getting diverted to landfills. Zero waste construction is one of the most effective approaches for this problem, which focus on reducing waste through reuse and recycling across the building life cycle. In this study, we critically evaluated the efficacy of these green rating systems both for developed and developing countries towards the zero-waste approach. It was found that in most cases even if a building is rated with a top-level certification by a green rating system, then also a large quantum of waste could have been generated during its construction and even at end-of-life demolition phases. This is mainly due to the missing application of green rating systems for achieving zero waste generation. Though these green rating systems also defined mandatory check credit points those are also limited to reduce the impact of waste to a certain level only. To overcome this problem, these rating systems must have a set of mandatory credit points leading to zero-waste construction, reduction, reuse and recycle of waste. This study will assist stakeholders in right selection of rating tool and will also lay the path for green rating agencies to refine their credit rating towards zero waste construction. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Author(s).\"\\n\"Chen C., Zhang Y., Bai Y., Li W.\",\"The impact of green credit on economic growth-The mediating effect of environment on labor supply\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115763192&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0257612&partnerID=40&md5=3300e4bc2cc428dd2b5b1ba8e9dd4ab6\",\"Background The progress of green credit in China is accelerating, but its development is uneven and insufficient in different regions. And whether the issuance of green credit can effectively promote the improvement of the environment and economy is not well understood. Objective Previous research has found that green credit promotes economic growth through improvement of the industrial structure and green technological innovation. However, these studies have not considered the positive externality of environmental improvement even though environmental improvement and economic growth are requirements of the sustainable development concept. Methods We use the chain-mediated model to estimate the impact of green credit issuance on the economic growth of different provinces since the large-scale implementation of green credit in China with data from 2008 to 2016. Results and conclusion This paper shows that the issuance of green credit can improve labor supply rather than labor productivity through the improvement of air quality to achieve regional economic growth. Such a chain-mediated path is different from the economic growth caused by industrial structural adjustment and green technology innovation. At the national level, every 1% increase in green credit issuance relative to industrial loans will increase the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) by approximately 4.6 yuan, or 0.012%, through air quality and labor supply, accounting for 2.875% of the total effect. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that due to regional industrial structure differences and diminishing marginal effects, the impact of green credit is stronger in the western region than in the eastern and central regions. For every 1% increase in the proportion of green credit issuance relative to industrial loans, the per capita GDP growth achieved through the chain-mediated path is approximately 30.17 yuan in the western region, approximately 6.6 times greater than that at the national level. Within a 95% confidence interval of 5000 bootstrap samples, this path is found to be true, and the chain-mediated effect accounts for approximately 12.96% of the total indirect effect. Limitations The limitation of this paper is the measurement of green credit. Although green credit has a large volume, it remains underdeveloped, and there is a lack of perfect indicators. Most existing studies have adopted only alternative or reverse indicators to measure the issuance of green credit. For example, this paper takes the interest expenditure of six high-energyconsuming enterprises as the reverse indicator, which may to a certain extent lead to the overestimation of the issuance of green credit and its impact on the environment and economy. Future research can accurately explore the performance of green credit on the basis of its mature development. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Chen et al.

In reality, all the customers are not fully trustworthy. There are some customers who do not pay the dues after enjoying the trade credit. The number of default customers increases with the increase in trade credit period given to them. Thus, these two contradict each other. There is a decent market with increasing demand for greener (contamination free) item(s), especially for deteriorating item(s). Here, in the present investigation, customers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 demand increases with both the trade credit given to customers and the greenness of the product. Obviously, the price tag will be higher for green items. Increased price always negates the demand. Hence, greenness and the increased price of the green products are contradictory to each other. Once more, to reduce the deterioration rate, the retailer incurs an expenditure termed as preservation technology cost. Due to preservation, deterioration of the items decreases but cost increases. Here, control of deterioration and preservation act contradictory to each other. The base demand, effects (coefficients) of the trade credit, and greenness are taken as fuzzy. Incorporating the above facts, a model is developed with a fuzzy differential equation and solved by Chalco-Cano \\xce\\xb1-cut method. The profit is calculated by assuming two-level trade credit and default customers. In this investigation, a new concept of clearing the supplier\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dues is introduced. Instead of payment of all dues at the end of business cycle period, the retailer clears his dues as and when he has sufficient money for this purpose. Numerical experiments for different cases are performed along with their physical interpretations. Imprecise nature of the profit is shown through its membership function and depicted graphically. Interestingly, it is demonstrated that positive effect of deterioration due to the increase in preservation technology and increase in profit due to greenness are up to certain extent. After that, these have the reverse effects. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\"\\n\"Liu F., Kang Y., Guo K., Sun X.\",\"The relationship between air pollution, investor attention and stock prices: Evidence from new energy and polluting sectors\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109479430&doi=10.1016%2fj.enpol.2021.112430&partnerID=40&md5=df6b4841e1de8df7e95ed5198e2296ea\",\"To meet its solemn commitments in the area of climate change and environmental protection, China is working to promote the development of green finance, hoping to direct more resources to green sectors such as the new energy industry. Data show that China is among the world leaders in the amount of green bond and green credit issuance, but green companies in China still do not receive enough support from the stock market. The purpose of this article is to identify the factors that affect the stock prices of new energy companies and to provide specific suggestions for improving stock performance, which will help new energy companies obtain finance in the stock market. This paper takes the listed new energy and polluting companies of China\\'s A-share market as research objects and uses the Baidu Index as a proxy for investor attention. A mediating effect model is adopted to investigate the transmission mechanism among air pollution, investor attention and stock prices. The results indicate that air pollution will not directly increase the stock prices of new energy companies, but it will directly reduce the stock prices of polluting companies. Moreover, the mediator between air pollution and stock prices is investor attention because both new energy and polluting enterprises receive more attention on trading days with air pollution, and increased investor attention could translate into higher stock prices. However, the results of the subsample analysis show that when the stock market shows an upward trend or fluctuates frequently, air pollution causes investors to pay less attention to both types of companies, and air pollution does not significantly reduce the stock prices of polluting companies. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Yao S., Pan Y., Sensoy A., Uddin G.S., Cheng F.\",\"Green credit policy and firm performance: What we learn from China\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108967490&doi=10.1016%2fj.eneco.2021.105415&partnerID=40&md5=10e8b82ee48e48ecf609e6b9c27f412d\",\"We explore the effect of green credit policy on firm performance of listed firms in China.

However, this requires effective methods for combining private and public funding. As an example of the barriers and opportunities facing practical implementation of a blended finance approach, this Viewpoint paper presents a case-study of the UK Peatland Code which will have relevance to other instances of blended finance initiatives elsewhere. Restoration of degraded peatlands reduces their carbon emissions and can provide emission reductions and other environmental gains in a socially cost-effective manner. However, many benefits are public goods arising as externalities which are difficult to convert into financial returns to private investors. To address this problem, the Peatland Code has been developed as a voluntary certification standard for UK peatland projects wishing to seek additional private funding via the voluntary carbon market. However, uptake of the Peatland Code has been slow. Despite growing demand in the voluntary carbon market, we observe six main barriers to supply-side uptake: lack of awareness amongst land managers; resistance to land use change, particularly when measures are seen to potentially compromise agricultural production; high upfront capital costs; limited equipment and skills; uncertainty over ongoing costs and support; and, administrative bureaucracy/inflexibility. We offer recommendations for how such barriers could be reduced to increase supply-side uptake, including: increased effort to promote sustainable land management and blended financing of it, and restoration activities and the Peatland Code in particular; continued public funding of upfront capital investments, with private funding directed more at ongoing payments; and, simplified and more flexible administrative arrangements, with public and private schemes designed in tandem to improve their practical complementarity. \\xc2\\xa9 2021\"\\n\"Fan H., Peng Y., Wang H., Xu Z.\",\"Greening through finance?\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107126231&doi=10.1016%2fj.jdeveco.2021.102683&partnerID=40&md5=026759827f07d5eba415a6b21552be7f\",\"This paper investigates how green credit regulation affects firms\\' loan conditions and their economic and environmental performance. In a simple theoretical model, with strengthened green credit regulations, banks raise loan interest rates to nonabatement firms. Firms that were formerly indifferent to pollution abatement must redetermine their abatement and production strategies. Using disaggregated firm-level data, we find that, after the reinforcement of green credit regulation, noncompliant firms saw a larger increase in interest rates, decrease in loan amounts, and more difficulty in access to loans. We further find different impacts on large and small firms in terms of their loans and their financial and economic responses. Regarding the impact on firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 environmental performance, although all of these firms reduced their total emissions, the reductions are realized in dissimilar ways; large firms reduced their emission intensity by investing more in adopting abatement facilities, while small firms simply choose to produce less. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Elsevier B.V.\"\\n\"Abimbola T., Christodoulatos C., Lawal A.\",\"Performance and optimization studies of oil extraction from Nannochloropsis spp. and Scenedesmus obliquus\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107387846&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2021.127295&partnerID=40&md5=e4bc8747421e187c28dae63c08354918\",\"The amount of water removed from harvested algae and the required quantity of solvent for efficient oil recovery impact the overall economic viability of transforming algae to bioenergy. Thus, in this study, the effect of total solids (TS) content and solvent-to-biomass ratio on oil recovery from Nannochloropsis oculata and Nannochloropsis salina (both referred to in this work as Nannocloropsis spp. and representative of marine species of algae) and Scenedesmus obliquus (a freshwater specie) was studied using modified Bligh & Dyer (B-D) method and Soxhlet extraction (with either hexane or ethanol as solvent). Adopting the modified B-D method, a maximum oil content exists between 10 and 20 wt% TS. Oil recovered with ethanol (with no pretreatment) and hexane (on acid hydrolyzed algae) with thimble increases with both TS (varied from 10 to 20 wt%) and solvent-to-biomass ratio (varied from 10 to 25). Conversely, oil yield increases with solvent-to-biomass ratio but reduces with TS due to enhanced mixing and mass transfer, increase in partition coefficient of lipids during downstream separation at lower TS, and implementation of hexane extraction without thimble. Hexane extraction was subsequently performed on acid hydrolyzed algae in a scale-up model and a 98% performance was achieved while about 60% of algal oil at the optimum data point was transformed to biodiesel with no significant impact by the solvent-to-biomass ratio or scale-up. Ethanol recovers mostly polar lipids and potentially forms an azeotrope with water which makes green diesel production less favorable and solvent recoverability challenging, respectively while the use of a large quantity of chloroform is unsafe. Thus, ethanol extraction and modified Bligh-Dyer methods were not performed in the scale-up model. Results from the application of our techno-economic analysis (TEA) model indicate that predicted sale price of Hydrotreated Algal Oil (HTAO) at each of the oil extraction data points decreases with increase in the oil content of algae, using a base case of 10000 barrel per day of HTAO with credits from animal feed and nutraceutical production. At the optimum data point, the predicted sale price of HTAO is $8.59 per gallon. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Zhang K., Wang Y., Huang Z.\",\"Do the green credit guidelines affect renewable energy investment?

This creates a new opportunity for the industry in the near future. The pulp and paper industry already utilizes vast amounts of biomass and produces large amounts of biogenic carbon dioxide. The industry is well poised for the use of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), which is considered as one of the key NETs. If the captured carbon dioxide can be used to manufacture green fuels to replace fossil ones, then this will generate a huge additional market where pulp and paper mills are on the front line. The objective of this study is to evaluate future trends and policies affecting the pulp and paper industry and to describe how a carbon neutral or carbon negative pulp and paper production process can be viable. Such policies include, as examples, price of carbon dioxide allowances or support for green fuel production and BECCS implemen-tation. It is known that profitability differs depending on mill type, performance, energy efficiency, or carbon dioxide intensity. The results give fresh understanding on the potential for investing in negative emission technologies. Carbon capture or green fuel production can be economical with an emission trade system, depending on electricity price, green fuel price, negative emission credit, and a mill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emission profile. However, feasibility does not seem to evidently correlate with the performance, technical age, or the measured efficiency of the mill. Application: This study gives fresh understanding on the potential for investing in negative emission technologies and green fuel production in the pulp and paper industry; thus, the results may be interesting to industrial oper-ators and policymakers. \\xc2\\xa9TAPPI Press 2021.\"\\n\"Sahoo K., Bergman R., Runge T.\",\"Life-cycle assessment of redwood lumber products in the US\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110805572&doi=10.1007%2fs11367-021-01937-7&partnerID=40&md5=3426681c6f2b2b7041d95c83f35e17c9\",\"Purpose: Global demand for construction materials has grown exponentially in the last century, contributing to climate change and detrimental impacts on the ecosystem. To aid in sustainable growth and reduce our environmental footprint, renewable construction materials, such as lumber, have been incorporated into green building activities. The purpose of this study was to quantify the environmental impacts associated with manufacturing redwood lumber in northern California using the life-cycle assessment (LCA) approach. Methods: This study surveyed and visited redwood manufacturing facilities in the US and collected data including lumber production, co-products, resource inputs, and direct emissions to air and water. The life-cycle inventory (LCI) was developed using the mass allocation of products and co-products. Cradle-to-grave (cradle-to-gate and gate-to-grave) LCA method was used to estimate the environmental impacts and energy usage in the production of redwood lumber (1 m3 of lumber), used in a redwood-deck, and its end-of-life (i.e., the deck was demolished after 25\\xc2\\xa0years of its life and redwood lumber disposed of in a landfill that captures methane). Results and discussions: About 48% of dry mass in the redwood logs were converted to lumber in the sawmill. Depending on the redwood lumber product analyzed, the cradle-to-gate cumulative fossil energy demand was estimated to be 1862 (522\\xe2\\x80\\x934877)\\xc2\\xa0MJ/m3 of redwood lumber produced. The cradle-to-gate and cradle-to-grave global warming (GW) impact were estimated at 36 (22\\xe2\\x80\\x9365) and 139 (127\\xe2\\x80\\x93167)\\xc2\\xa0kgCO2eq/m3 of lumber, respectively. Upstream operations (including silviculture, harvesting, and transport) and mainstream (mill) operations (including sawing, drying, and planing) contributed 53% and 47% of total cradle-to-gate GW impact, respectively. However, the disposal of the redwood lumber products was the most dominant contributor (45\\xe2\\x80\\x9365%) to the cradle-to-grave GW impact of redwood lumber. Carbon stored in the whole lifecycle of redwood lumber is about 4 (range of 3\\xe2\\x80\\x925) times more than its cradle-to-grave carbon footprint (CFP), a substantial environmental benefit. Considering credits from co-generation (used mill residues to generate both heat and electricity) supplying renewable electricity to the local grid decreases the net GW impact from \\xe2\\x88\\x92 468 to \\xe2\\x88\\x92 579 kgCO2eq/m3 of lumber. Many redwood lumber products such as decking are used green (freshly-cut), and a large portion of green lumber is only air-dried, which has a much lower GW impact than kiln-dried (force-dried) lumber. Also, even if the lumber requires kiln-drying, the heat comes from burning on-site mill processing residues, considered a carbon\\xe2\\x80\\x93neutral energy source. For lumber\\xc2\\xa0production life-cycle stages, kiln-drying\\xc2\\xa0of lumber tends to use a lot of thermal energy (albeit mostly from mill residues) compared with the whole life cycle. However, the GW impact from the redwood lumber drying unit process is low, only 27%, because the product tends to be used green. Furthermore, using mill residues to produce on-site combined heat and power (co-generation) was shown to be the most efficient way to reduce the environmental footprints of lumber production. Conclusion: Overall, the results showed that redwood lumber production has a negative GW impact and acts as a carbon sink if used in the construction sector. Specifically, the final products store 3\\xe2\\x80\\x935 times more greenhouse gas emissions over than what is released from cradle-to-grave. There are large differences in GW impact among five categories of redwood lumber products and the rough-green lumber types have the lowest GW impact (or highest GW reduction potential) among all. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\"\\n\"Luo S., Yu S., Zhou G.\",\"Does green credit improve the core competence of commercial banks?

The over-consumption of non-renewable resources causes pollution which leads to global warming. Consequently, government agencies have been taking several initiatives to control the over-consumption of non-renewable natural resources and encourage the production of renewable energy resources. In this regard, we introduce an IoT powered integrated framework called as green home architecture (GHA) for green score calculation based on the usage of natural resources for household purpose. Green score is a credit point (i.e.,10 pts) of a family which can be calculated once in a month based on the utilization of energy, production of renewable energy and pollution caused. The green score can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy, generation of renewable energy and preventing the pollution. The main objective of GHA is to monitor the day-to-day usage of resources and calculate the green score using the proposed green score algorithm. This algorithm gives positive credits for economic consumption of resources and production of renewable energy and also it gives negative credits for pollution caused. Here, we recommend a green score based tax calculation system which gives tax exemption based on the green score value. This direct beneficiary model will appreciate and encourage the citizens to consume fewer natural resources and prevent pollution. Rather than simply giving subsidy, this proposed system allows monitoring the subsidy scheme periodically and encourages the proper working system with tax exemption rewards. Also, our GHA will be used to monitor all the household appliances, vehicles, wind mills, electricity meter, water re-treatment plant, pollution level to read the consumption/production in appropriate units by using the suitable sensors. These values will be stored in mass storage platform like cloud for the calculation of green score and also employed for billing purpose by the government agencies. This integrated platform can replace the manual billing and directly benefits the government. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 KSII.\"\\n\"Ibada A.J., Ehkan P., Ngadiran R., Hammood D.A., Alkhayyat A.\",\"RGB Image Encryption using Hill Algorithm and Chaos System\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111980182&doi=10.1088%2f1742-6596%2f1962%2f1%2f012061&partnerID=40&md5=688148df1015b0364283000cb2dd232d\",\"The development of modern technology in recent years, makes the data security very big issue.

Using a set of panel data including 30 provinces and cities, this study focused on the impact of green credit on carbon dioxide emissions in China from 2006 to 2016. The empirical results indicated that green credit has a significantly negative effect on carbon dioxide emissions intensity. Furthermore, after the mechanism examination, we found that the promotion impacts of green credit on industrial structure upgrading and technological innovation are two effective channels to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Heterogeneity analysis found that there are regional differences in the effect of green credit. In the western and northeastern regions, the effect of green credit is invalid. Quantile regression results implied that the greater the carbon emissions intensity, the better the effect of green credit. Finally, a further discussion revealed there exists a nonlinear correlation between green credit and carbon dioxide emissions intensity. These findings suggest that the core measures to promote carbon emission reduction in China are to continue to expand the scale of green credit, increase the technology R&D investment of enterprises, and to vigorously develop the tertiary industry. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 by the authors.

This study investigates a supply chain system consisting of a capital-constrained manufacturer and a well-funded supplier facing uncertain demand, in which the manufacturer may seek GCF from banks. An important prerequisite for obtaining a green loan is that the borrower must make green upgrades and ensure compliance with pre-specified environmental standards. We design a GCF model for a supply chain by imposing a hard constraint on carbon emissions. To determine the effectiveness of GCF, we conduct an in-depth analysis comparing the GCF with traditional trade credit financing (TCF), in which excessive carbon emissions are penalized. The optimal equilibrium solutions under GCF and TCF mode are obtained and their sensitivities to key parameters analyzed. Concerning the preferences of the two financing strategies, we find that under a relatively strict carbon emission policy, the manufacturer can set an appropriate green investment range to achieve a win-win situation with the supplier. Finally, we compare the social welfare of the supply chain for the different financing modes and find that there are regions in which both the social welfare and profit of the manufacturer can be a win-win. The government can guide manufacturers to make a win-win choice by setting different carbon caps. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 Elsevier B.V.\"\\n\"Sun Y., Gao H., Yuan X.\",\"Influencing Factors Study on Green Development Using Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109161228&doi=10.1088%2f1742-6596%2f1952%2f4%2f042120&partnerID=40&md5=988c21e072b5f6a6272f30a4aaf93007\",\"The rapid economic development and high incidence of crises in emerging economies make them play an increasingly important role in the transmission of global financial risks.

Hotels face pressure from the global market to improve their sustainability performance by implementing green practices. In meeting the requirements of sustainable practice, green management\\'s goal focuses on reducing, eliminating, and preventing adverse effects arising from environmental activities. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, IGI Global.\"\\n\"Xiong K., Yao Y.\",\"Research on China\\'s Green Finance Promoting Sustainable Economic Development\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108406756&doi=10.1051%2fe3sconf%2f202127502049&partnerID=40&md5=f3dd69262296ea00cd911bdac92721a4\",\"With China\\'s economic development entering a new normal, green finance has become a new direction to explore the sustainable development of economy in the supply side structural reform task of \"\"three removal, one reduction and one compensation\"\".

Secondly, taking green credit as an example, this paper makes an empirical study on the contribution of green finance to sustainable economic development. Finally, according to the results of empirical research, some suggestions including increasing the application proportion of green finance, improving green financial products and business model and forming a market mechanism for green finance to promote green development independently, are put forward to improve the sustainable development of green finance in China. \\xc2\\xa9 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.\"\\n\"Su J., Cao L., Lee G., Tyler J., Ringsred A., Rensing M., van Dyk S., O\\'Connor D., Pinchuk R., Saddler J.J.\",\"Challenges in determining the renewable content of the final fuels after co-processing biogenic feedstocks in the fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) of a commercial oil refinery\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102068500&doi=10.1016%2fj.fuel.2021.120526&partnerID=40&md5=2ca7e0c47664ffaa6291c5b63d727739\",\"The long-distance transport sector will be difficult to electrify and will likely require lower-carbon intensive, drop-in fuels if the sector is to effectively decarbonize. Policies such as the low carbon fuels standard (LCFS) have proven to be particularly effective in encouraging oil companies to produce lower carbon intensity (CI) fuels that the long-distance transport sector can use. One way to reduce the carbon intensity of the fuels is to co-process lower carbon intensive feedstock at various insertion points within a refinery (e.g. the hydrotreater or the fluid catalytic cracker (FCC)). However, to obtain \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccredits\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from the appropriate regulator the carbon intensity of the final fuel and the renewable content must be determined. To date several processes, such as material balance and C14/C13-tracking, have been used to determine the renewable content of the final fuels, with each of these methods having their own strengths and weaknesses. As described here, challenges such as the lack of consistent terminology, through to variations in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbackground noise\\xe2\\x80\\x9d encountered in typical refinery operation, have complicated carbon intensity and renewable content determinations. However, when a co-processing approach is used in a routinely operating refinery, a multiple regression-based mass balance approach (based on observed yield) combined with C14 analysis is able to determine the renewable content of the final fuels. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n[No author name available],\"7th International Conference on Mathematics, Science, and Education 2020, ICMSE 2020 - Preface\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108838906&partnerID=40&md5=269975d1c0dc731ad198087351dcb24d\",\"The proceedings contain 324 papers.

It has a very strategic geographical position, located in the tropics and having high rainfall. The banking sector has a vital role in economic development. Even though bank business activities do not have a direct impact on the environment, banks can protect the environment through credit financing management. The problem observed in this study is the role of agricultural credit financing in realizing green banking in Indonesia. This research uses a normative juridical method supported by a literature review. The results show that the agricultural sector is directly in contact with society and has the potential to damage the environment. The protection from the banking sector is greatly needed to conserve the environment. Any form of potential environmental damage can be prevented through a special clause in the credit agreement. In conclusion, banks have a significant contribution to realizing the environmental sustainability of agricultural activities in Indonesia. At present, green banking in credit agreements has not included a clause regarding environmental management. This research suggests the banks to include a clause on environmental protection in credit agreements in accordance with the concept of green banking. \\xc2\\xa9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\"\\n\"Zhao Y., Yue Y., Wei P.\",\"Financing Advantage of Green Corporate Asset-Backed Securities and its Impact Factors: Evidence in China\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108158703&doi=10.3389%2ffenrg.2021.696110&partnerID=40&md5=a51fee8c61c3758b5154abf9d25a532d\",\"As an innovative green financial tool, green corporate asset-backed securities can effectively solve the problems of narrow financing channels and maturity mismatches for green projects, which can help achieve green and low-carbon development, carbon peaking, and carbon neutrality goals.

Nonparametric tests were used to assess category and credit achievement, i.e., the difference between possible and achieved points and the correlation between associated credits. The results show that most of the credits in the location and transportation category and the indoor environmental quality categories had a high level of achievement, a few credits in the energy and atmosphere and materials and resources categories had a high level of achievement, and all of the credits in the water efficiency category had a low level of achievement. Some associated credits, such as surrounding density and quality transit, had a high level of achievement and a positive correlation, whereas other associated credits, such as life-cycle impact reduction and environmental product declarations, had a low level of achievement and a positive correlation. If LEED-CIv4 credits meet the requirements of the California Green Building Standards Code 2016 (CGBSC 2016), then these credits typically have a medium/high level of achievement. If LEED-CIv4 credits exceed the requirements of CGBSC 2016, then these credits have a low level of achievement. Therefore, to improve the next version of LEED-CI, it is necessary to improve the local green codes. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, College Publishing.

The study introduces dynamic ARDL panels in the context of the traditional environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) and renewable Kuznets curve (RKC). The results indicated an inverse-N-shaped and a U-shaped pattern. Energy consumption and labour productivity enhanced pollution, while domestic credit to the private sector, as a share of GDP, and renewable energy consumption supported environmental protection. The implications of these results might help these countries to achieve the targets of the European Green Deal related to the reduction of pollution and the attainment of net zero emissions by 2050. However, national regulations should further promote the use of renewable energy sources. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 by the authors.

Matcha is remotely popular among the global community and meagerly researched and infamous among the scientific population. It is the powdered form of green tea leaves that are directly suspended in hot water and drunk without filtration. Matcha is said to be one of the richest antioxidant sources naturally available. This review summarizes the available research publications related to matcha and compares the research accomplishments of green tea and matcha researchers. The fact that green tea is backed up by 35,000 publications while matcha has merely 54 publications to its credit is highlighted in this review for the first time. The future of matcha for tapping its enormous antioxidant activity and health potentials remains connected to the volume of scientific awareness and enhanced research attention in this area. If green tea has so much to offer towards human health and welfare, there is certainly room for more benefits from matcha, which is yet to be disclosed. As public awareness cannot be won without scientific approval, this review seeks that this gap may be bridged using essential knowledge gained from matcha applications and allied research. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 by the authors.

Then, the coupling model was adopted to study the coupling degree and the coupling coordination degree between them, and the regression model was employed to further study the influence coefficient of green credit on the optimization and rationalization of industrial structure.

We are interested in the impact of the central bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GCP on the profits and optimal strategies of manufacturers and suppliers related to POF (purchase order financing). Specifically, we build a game-theoretical model consisting of a manufacturer, a bank and a green supplier and a non-green supplier. Furthermore, the optimal strategies of the manufacturer and suppliers when the bank or the government sets a carbon emission cap on suppliers are discussed. We come to some important conclusions about a GCP that promotes the development of green projects since it brings higher profits to both the manufacturer and suppliers than the lack of a GCP. Furthermore, the higher the production cost, the better the effect of a GCP. Under the carbon emission restrictions required by the government, the effect of GCP is weakened and the profits of the manufacturer and the suppliers are reduced to zero due to the gradually increasing delivery risks as production costs increase. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 by the authors.

The CRBFT algorithm divides the nodes into three types, each with different responsibilities: master node, sub-nodes, and candidate nodes, and sets the credit attribute to the node. The node\\'s credit can be adjusted adaptively through the reinforcement learning algorithm, which can dynamically change the state of nodes. CRBFT algorithm can automatically identify malicious nodes and invalid nodes, making them exit from the consensus network. Experimental results show that the CRBFT algorithm can effectively improve the consensus network\\'s security. Besides, compared with the PBFT algorithm, in CRBFT, the consensus delay is reduced by about 40%, and the traffic overhead is reduced by more than 45%. This reduction is conducive to save energy and reduce emissions. \\xc2\\xa9 2021\"\\n\"Dafermos Y., Nikolaidi M.\",\"How can green differentiated capital requirements affect climate risks?

We identify the transmission channels by which these green differentiated capital requirements (GDCRs) can affect credit provision and loan spreads, and we analyse these channels within a dynamic framework in which climate and macrofinancial feedback effects play a key role. Our main findings are as follows. First, GDCRs can reduce the pace of global warming and decrease thereby the physical financial risks. This reduction is quantitatively small, but is enhanced when the GSF and the DPF are implemented simultaneously or in combination with green fiscal policies. Second, the DPF reduces banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 credit provision and leverage, making them less fragile. Third, both the DPF and the GSF generate some transition risks: the GSF increases bank leverage because it boosts green credit and the DPF increases loan defaults since it reduces economic activity. These effects are small in quantitative terms and are attenuated when there is a simultaneous implementation of the DPF and the GSF. Fourth, fiscal policies that boost green investment amplify the transition risks of the GSF and reduce the transition risks of the DPF; the combination of green fiscal policy with the DPF is thereby a potentially effective climate policy mix from a financial stability point of view. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Elsevier B.V.\"\\n\"Yu C.-H., Wu X., Zhang D., Chen S., Zhao J.\",\"Demand for green finance: Resolving financing constraints on green innovation in China\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104058997&doi=10.1016%2fj.enpol.2021.112255&partnerID=40&md5=997246819697777637134975c9f9aeda\",\"This paper investigates the effects of financing constraints on prompting green innovations using a sample of Chinese listed firms in the period 2001\\xe2\\x80\\x932017. Also, we explore how green finance policies resolve financing constraints of firms to green innovation. The capability of green innovation is found to be impaired when firms face higher financing constraints, and privately owned enterprises tend to be more vulnerable than state-owned ones in this regard. Although green finance policies can effectively ease financing restraints on green innovation overall, green credits are less likely to be available to privately owned enterprises. However, these enterprises which are deeply affected by financing constraints have relatively high innovation capabilities. We suggest the government to provide more supports to privately owned enterprises for investing in green projects. Further, both financial institutions and privately owned enterprises should be required to disclose more information on green credits and green projects, respectively. In addition, the China Banking Regulatory Commission should design a synthetic mechanism for evaluating green performance. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Dunz N., Naqvi A., Monasterolo I.\",\"Climate sentiments, transition risk, and financial stability in a stock-flow consistent model\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104058151&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfs.2021.100872&partnerID=40&md5=903a7b49ac009cf89f64ff91a3d45e85\",\"A successful low-carbon transition requires the introduction of policies aimed at aligning investments to the climate and sustainability targets. In this regard, a global Carbon Tax (CT) and a revision of the microprudential banking framework via a Green Supporting Factor (GSF) have been advocated but two main knowledge gaps remain. First, the understanding of the conditions under which the CT or the GSF could contribute to the scaling-up of new green investments or, in contrast, could introduce new sources of risk for macroeconomic and financial stability, is poor. Second, we don\\'t know how banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 climatesentiments, i.e. their anticipation of climate policies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 impact in lending conditions, could affect the outcomes of the policies and of the low-carbon transition. To fill these knowledge gaps we develop a Stock-Flow Consistent model of a high income country that embeds an adaptive forecasting function of banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 climate sentiments. Then, we assess the impact of the CT and GSF on the greening of the economy and on the banking sector analyzing the risk transmission channels from the credit market to the economy via loans contracts, and the reinforcing feedbacks that could give rise to cascading effects. Our results suggest that the GSF contributes to scale up green investments only in the short-run but it also introduces potential trade-offs on bank\\'s financial stability. To foster the low-carbon transition while preventing unintended effects on Non-Performing Loans and households\\xe2\\x80\\x99 budget, the introduction of the CT should be complemented with redistribution welfare policies. Finally, if banks revise their credit supply conditions based on the firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 carbon profile ahead of climate policy introduction, they can contribute to align investments to the low-carbon transition and improve financial stability of the banking sector. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Elsevier B.V.\"\\n\"Agliardi E., Agliardi R.\",\"Pricing climate-related risks in the bond market\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103756154&doi=10.1016%2fj.jfs.2021.100868&partnerID=40&md5=96564e5c1498b6e41fb0645237af9675\",\"We develop a model for defaultable bonds incorporating both uncertainty about corporate earnings and uncertainty due to climate-related risks, which determine downward jumps in the firm value.

Using data on Chinese-listed ECEP firms from 2010 to 2019, this work quantitatively identifies the financing efficiency of these firms and its determinants. The main results show that banks are still dominant in the Chinese financial market for providing credits, and firms listed on the second board show higher financing efficiency. The financing efficiency of firms located in the central and western regions improves significantly, especially after 2016, reflecting the interaction effect of green finance policies and economic policies supporting underdeveloped regions. Both country-level factors (e.g., formal institutions and financial supervision) and firm-level factors (e.g., firm size and debt ratio) have an impact on financing efficiency. These findings have important implications for policymakers who are carefully contemplating green finance policies to support ECEP firms through an effective financial market mechanism, which eventually helps to realize the transition of the energy sector. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Tomasiello S., Alijani Z.\",\"Fuzzy-based approaches for agri-food supply chains: a mini-review\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103044577&doi=10.1007%2fs00500-021-05707-3&partnerID=40&md5=bd226f70e6414b49b912969640a04943\",\"A survey on the technologies employed in the modern agriculture and agri-food supply chains lately appeared, but only one paper using a fuzzy-based approach was cited. The aim of the present mini-review is to complement the above-mentioned survey and to show the application of different fuzzy-based approaches for agri-food supply chains. Agri-food supply chains represent linked events in the agricultural production of food, where all the stages of production, processing, trading, distribution and consumption are involved. These supply chains are expected to provide sustainable, affordable, safe and sufficient food and other derivatives to the consumers. Hence, it is critical to ensure that they operate properly and successfully in the volatile business environment. A first concern is to assess the service ability of the whole supply chain to preserve agri-food quality, eliminate deterioration and meet the demands of customers. Due to their complex structure, agri-food supply chains are susceptible to several vulnerabilities and risks, such as breakdowns, operational difficulties, and credit loss and economic losses due to various uncertain factors. A risk analysis can help to identify and categorize the risks. In this era characterized by the rapid industrialization of the agriculture and the increased global food demand, the sustainability and transparency of supply chains have become key factors. The new focus on sustainability emphasizes the issue of striking a balance between ecological and economic aspects in the agri-food business. In this context, problems such as the green supplier selection gained special attention. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\"\\n\"Wang X., Zhao H., Bi K.\",\"The measurement of green finance index and the development forecast of green finance in China\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101490308&doi=10.1007%2fs10651-021-00483-7&partnerID=40&md5=e286b1dfd03bec99b87d7d5fd6e0df6d\",\"This paper proposes a green finance index that may help policymakers and investors take more favorable actions based on the development of green finance.

Previous studies report that the economic left\\xe2\\x80\\x93right dimension has an impact on credit ratings. However, recent literature shows that there are no significant differences between right-wing and left-wing debt-related policies. In addition, current political developments, such as the rise of populist movements, indicate that the economic left\\xe2\\x80\\x93right dimension may not be sufficient to describe how political ideology affects governments\\xe2\\x80\\x99 actions and thereby credit ratings. Therefore, this paper suggests that the socio-cultural dimension of political ideology or the GAL-TAN (Green\\xe2\\x80\\x93Alternative\\xe2\\x80\\x93Liberal vs. Traditionalist\\xe2\\x80\\x93Authoritarian\\xe2\\x80\\x93Nationalist) also impacts a country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rating. In particular, the study proposes that TAN-leaning governments are perceived as a risk factor for debt repayment because they are less likely to adhere to rule of law and are reluctant to cooperate with international organizations and other domestic political parties. They also prefer protectionist policies for cultural reasons. Using data from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey for 24 European countries between 1999 and 2019, the results show that governments with TAN-leaning major parties are associated with lower sovereign credit ratings.

The consortium improved the levels of alkaline phosphatase, \\xce\\xb2-D glucosidase, dehydrogenase, sucrase and urease (up to 33%) as compared to the control. The bacterial inoculum also triggered increases in plant fresh weight, pigments and antioxidants. The consortium application enhanced significantly the metals bioavailability (DTPA extractable) and mobilization (acid soluble fraction), relative to those in the unamended soil; therefore, significantly improved the metals uptake by roots and shoots. The phytoextraction indices indicated that B. juncea is an efficient accumulator of Cd and Zn. Overall, co-application of ACT and BC can be an effective solution for enhancing phytoremediation potential and thus reducing the potential human health risk from smelter-contaminated soil. Field studies may further credit the understanding of consortium interactions with soil and different plant systems in remediating multi-metal contaminated environments. Bacterial consortium-of Actinobacteria (Streptomyces pactum) and Firmicutes (Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis) promoted soil enzymes activities, metals availability, plant growth and thereby enhanced metals phytoextraction efficiency by Brassica juncea. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Thiruselvi D., Kumar P.S., Kumar M.A., Lay C.-H., Aathika S., Mani Y., Jagadiswary D., Dhanasekaran A., Shanmugam P., Sivanesan S., Show P.-L.\",\"A critical review on global trends in biogas scenario with its up-gradation techniques for fuel cell and future perspectives\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094590573&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijhydene.2020.10.023&partnerID=40&md5=767ef38b38ef342b193c868bd75609b4\",\"Renewable biogas production technology is an excellent method for eradication of greenhouse gas emission and thereby reducing global warming.

A lot of research and development is carried out in the field of daylight harvesting, which is the need of the hour. One of the most desirable attributes of daylight harvesting is that daylight is available universally and it is a very clean and cost-efficient form of energy. By using the various methods of daylight harvesting, it is possible to attain the global Sustainable Development Goals. Daylight harvesting in the most fundamental sense is the lighting strategy control of the artificial light in an interior space where daylight is also present so that the required illumination level is achieved. This way, a lot of energy can be saved. Recently, in addition to energy efficiency, other factors such as cost-efficiency, user requirements such as uniform illuminance, and different levels of illuminance at different points are being considered. To simulate the actual daylight contribution for an office building in urban Chennai, India before construction, ECO TECH software is used by providing the inputs such as building orientation, and reflectance\\xe2\\x80\\x99s values of the ceiling, wall, and floor to analyze the overall percentage of daylight penetration available versus the percentage prescribed in the Indian Green Building Council to obtain the credit points.

These sulphonate grafts, which are characterized using spectroscopy and electron microscopy, decrease the propensity for acid absorption by the bare quantum dot material, which also credits enormous photo-action for lactic acid transformation into lactates. Mechanistically sulphonate species get energized by capturing an electron excited by titania under UV irradiation, consequently stimulating the adsorbed lactic acid molecules.

Based on the behavior of microeconomic entities we construct a Dynamic Stochastic Genernal Equilibrium (DSGE) model to analyze the output and welfare effect of green credit in China. Specifically, the incentive green credit is taken as an example to carry out an empirical study, and we further quantitatively measure the output and welfare effect of green credit under different environmental regulations. We find that both price-based and quantity-based green credit have obvious output, environment, health and utility welfare effect, which is conducive to the green upgrading of industrial structure and can achieve a win-win situation of output and environment in China. However, there are some differences in transmission mechanism and utility welfare. In addition, in the short term, the environmental tax regulation inhibits the economic expansion effect of green credit, and in the long term, this inhibitory effect gradually disappears. The DSGE comprehensive evaluation framework constructed in this paper expands the application scope of DSGE model, and provides a quantitative theoretical model for the mechanism analysis of China\\'s green credit policy and similar policies.

The current understanding of Taiwan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s NIS draws mainly on Taiwan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s catch-up model, referring especially to export-oriented ICT industrialisation, and gives special credit to government-sponsored applied research institutes, such as the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). However, Taiwan nowadays is promoting economic transformation and the digital economy, with a central focus on 5+N flagship innovative industries, including the Asian Silicon Valley Development Initiative for the IoT and smart cities, green energy (offshore wind power and other kinds of renewable energy), the biomedical industry, the defense sector (cybersecurity included), new agriculture (for example precision agriculture) and the circular economy. Following this, the Institute for Information Industry (III) has recently repositioned itself as a \\xe2\\x80\\x98Digital Transformation Enabler\\xe2\\x80\\x99, while ITRI tends to focus on systemic innovations, by taking an approach of \\xe2\\x80\\x98Open Innovation System Platform\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (OISP). There is increasing awareness that digitalisation is transforming innovation and that digital transformation brings challenges to innovation management and innovation policies. Set against that backdrop, this chapter calls for a revisit to Taiwan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s NIS by examining the issue concerning what Taiwan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s transition from ICT industrialisation to the digital economy means to its innovation trajectory and innovation routines. Taiwan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ICT industry is a legacy of its catch-up industrialisation, and it has to reinvent itself in order to evolve into the genuine \\xe2\\x80\\x98digital sector\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of the digital economy. For Taiwan to develop into a digital economy, the incumbents in the existing digital sector or new players from elsewhere have to master a variety of new digital technologies (hardware- or software-based), such as AI, the IoT, robotics and blockchain, and/or to harness the new technologies for innovative applications. This may enrich our understanding of the factors underlying industrial innovation in the era of the digital economy, especially for latecomer countries in transition. The chapter goes further to discuss some aspects of structural change in Taiwan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s NIS. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 selection and editorial matter, Gee San and Patarapong Intarakumnerd.\"\\n\"Wang Y., Lei X., Zhao D., Long R., Wu M.\",\"The dual impacts of green credit on economy and environment: Evidence from China\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105188556&doi=10.3390%2fsu13084574&partnerID=40&md5=bc4a67f014543b6c73bf118d7edebdb8\",\"Green credit is regarded as an important means to promote sustainable growth. Based on the provincial panel dataset of China from 2007 to 2017, this paper investigates the dual impacts of green credit on the economy and environment, and it establishes mediating effect models to analyze the Porter hypothesis. The results show that the green credit policy significantly improves economic performance and reduces pollutant emissions. The above results are robust to employing methods with alternative variables and instrumental variables. Second, the green credit policy contributes to innovation; that is, the green credit increases the innovation scale and improves innovation efficiency. The results of mediating effect models suggest that the Porter effect of green credit can be achieved by improving innovation efficiency.

Using the entropy weight method, this paper establishes and evaluates a com-prehensive industrial pollution index that contains and synthesizes six major industrial pollutants (wastewater, COD, waste gas, SO2, NOx, and solid waste) in the 2006\\xe2\\x80\\x932015 period. Subsequently, this paper studies the spatiotemporal characteristics and influencing factors of industrial pollution via the Moran index and spatial econometric analysis. The empirical results indicate that (1) the temporal evolution of the industrial pollution index is characterized by an overall trend of first decreasing and then increasing. (2) The industrial pollution index of each county has certain geographical disparities and significant spatially polarized characteristics in 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2015. (3) The Moran test shows that there is a relatively significant spatial autocorrelation of the industrial pollution index among counties and that the geographical distribution of the industrial pollution index tends to show clustering. (4) Spatial regression models that incorporate spatial factors better explain the influencing factors of industrial pollution. The economic development level, technological progress, and industrialization are negatively correlated with industrial pollution, while population density and industrial production capacity are positively correlated. (5) Consequently, as relevant policy recommendations, this paper proposes that environmental cooperation linkage mechanisms, environmental protection credit systems, and green technology innovation systems should be established in different geographical locations to achieve the goals of green county construction and sustainable development. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 by the authors.

We found that: (1) green credit policies can help reduce the risk of maturity mismatch between investment and financing for polluting companies; (2) the reduction of short-term bank credit is the main way to curb the risk of maturity mismatch risk between investment and financing; (3) the green credit policy has no obvious mitigation effect on the risk of maturity mismatch between investment and financing among polluting companies with environmental protection investment; (4) the mitigation effect of the green credit policy on the maturity mismatch risk is more significant in state-owned polluting companies and polluting companies in areas with a lower level of financial development. The empirical results show that China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s green credit policy helps stimulate the environmental protection behaviour of companies, as well as helping alleviate the capital chain risk caused by the maturity mismatch between investment and financing.

Lack of trust and security of cloud manufacturing platforms are the bottleneck problems. How to ensure the credit of both trading sides and reduce the transaction risk and transaction cost are still urgent problems to be solved. In recent years, with the continuous development and maturity of blockchain technology, it has attracted widespread attention in the manufacturing field. Its characteristics of trustlessness, anti-tampering, traceability, and high transparency provide new ideas for the development of cloud manufacturing platforms and solving the above problems. However, the traditional consensus protocol has problems such as token dependence and high energy consumption, which is not suitable for the special scenario of cloud manufacturing with a large number of big deals. This paper proposes a blockchain consensus protocol of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cProof of Service Power\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (PoSP) for application scenarios of cloud manufacturing. The consensus mechanism uses historical transaction information accumulated by member nodes in a cloud manufacturing system to calculate the service power of member nodes, which greatly reduces energy consumption in the Proof of Work (PoW) process. An introduction of the credit incentive mechanism makes PoSP consensus protocol get rid of token dependence while providing a quantitative basis for trust evaluation for each participant in the cloud manufacturing system. The experimental results show that the consensus mechanism for proof of service power has a good incentive effect, and it has lower energy consumption and higher transaction per second (TPS) than the proof of work and proof of stake (PoS). This study provides new ideas and a reference pattern for the application of blockchain technology in cloud manufacturing platform. \\xc2\\xa9 2021\"\\n\"Howell E.T., Benoit N.\",\"Nutrient footprints on the Toronto-Mississauga waterfront of Lake Ontario\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099497246&doi=10.1016%2fj.jglr.2020.11.009&partnerID=40&md5=f25221814a144fcf9ecce50cf676933f\",\"The extent of nutrient enrichment over the urbanized shoreline of western Lake Ontario bordering the Cities of Toronto and Mississauga was investigated in 2018. Concentrations of total phosphorus were higher and more wide-ranging compared with nearshore reference areas in eastern Lake Ontario. Area-weighted chlorophyll a was higher over the shoreline from the mouth of the Credit River to Humber Bay west of Toronto Harbour compared with that to the east from the Toronto Beaches to the Rouge River, a pattern also seen broadly in concentrations of phosphorus fractions and nitrates. Concentrations of phosphate measured by mass spectrometry, and using an internal standard to minimize sampling losses, were higher in Toronto Inner Harbour, near wastewater outfalls, river mouths, and to varying extent over the mixing areas of these discharges. Chlorophyll a suggested broadly oligotrophic to oligo-mesotrophic conditions despite areas with nutrient fractions suggestive of more productive conditions. Toronto Inner Harbour was mesotrophic, with wide-ranging levels of phosphorus fractions strongly influenced by the variable loading from the Don River into the harbour. Phosphorus fractions in the harbour quays which also receive CSOs discharges were elevated at times. Blooms or scums of planktonic algae were not observed. Elevated concentrations of phosphate were found at shallow depths suitable for growth of the green algae Cladophora. As these urban areas continue to grow, the potential for additional nutrient loading to exacerbate growth of algae should be watched given the present conditions that indicate variable but pervasive nutrient enrichment. \\xc2\\xa9 2020\"\\n\"Chen H., Wang J., Miao Y.\",\"Evolutionary game analysis on the selection of green and low carbon innovation between manufacturing enterprises\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098660866&doi=10.1016%2fj.aej.2020.12.015&partnerID=40&md5=2a5dfd699d5a175f0bd18cb4fbcefebd\",\"Focusing on the selection of green and low carbon (GLC) innovation, this paper builds an evolutionary game between manufacturing enterprises, and another model between an enterprise and the government.

The results show that the game between manufacturing enterprises will eventually converge, due to the cost advantage of some enterprises in traditional innovation and the spillover effect of GLC innovation results. Some enterprise will choose GLC innovation, but some will adhere to traditional innovation, while sharing part of the revenue of GLC innovation of others. After government intervention, the innovation behaviors of manufacturing enterprises will be compensated for, rewarded, or penalized by means of transfer payment, tax credit, etc. As a result, all enterprises will eventually switch to GLC innovation. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 THE AUTHORS\"\\n\"Pahlevan A., Zapater M., Coskun A.K., Atienza D.\",\"ECOGreen: Electricity Cost Optimization for Green Datacenters in Emerging Power Markets\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083708136&doi=10.1109%2fTSUSC.2020.2983571&partnerID=40&md5=f1cfc20c0b6afa6b21252e8e69ed345f\",\"Modern datacenters need to tackle efficiently the increasing demand for computing resources while minimizing energy usage and monetary costs. Power market operators have recently introduced emerging demand-response programs, in which electricity consumers regulate their power usage following provider requests to reduce monetary costs. Among different programs, regulation service (RS) reserves are particularly promising for datacenters due to the high credit gain possibilities and datacenters\\' flexibility in regulating their power consumption. Therefore, it is essential to develop bidding strategies for datacenters to participate in emerging power markets together with power management policies that are aware of power market requirements at runtime. In this paper we propose ECOGreen, a holistic strategy to jointly optimize the datacenter RS problem and virtual machine (VM) allocation that satisfies the hour-ahead power market constraints in the presence of electrical energy storage (EES) and renewable energy. We first find the best power and reserve bidding values as well as the number of active servers in a fast analytical way that works well in practice. Then, we present an online adaptive policy that modulates datacenter power consumption by controlling VMs CPU resource limits and efficiently utilizing demand-side EES and renewable power, while guaranteeing quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Our results demonstrate that ECOGreen can provide 76 percent of the datacenter power consumption on average as reserves to the market, due to largely operating on renewable sources and EES. This translates into ECOGreen saving up to 71 percent electricity costs when compared to other state-of-the-art datacenter electricity cost minimization techniques that participate in the power market. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 IEEE.\"\\n\"Ghosh P.K., Manna A.K., Dey J.K., Kar S.\",\"Supply chain coordination model for green product with different payment strategies: A game theoretic approach\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099237654&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2020.125734&partnerID=40&md5=281ffcea983e5d2e8901f613f929977e\",\"In our world, pollution arising from various sources like factories and vehicles, threaten the very environment we live in.

The study tested for co-integration using the Johansen technique, which is evident and applied the vector error correction model (VECM) on the annual data for the period 1990-2015. The results indicate a bi-directional causality between renewable energy consumption (REC) and economic growth (GDP). REC positively granger causes GDP in both short-run and long-run, while GDP has an adverse effect on REC in the short run. Historical decomposition of shocks reveals the relative implications of renewable energy shocks on GDP to be mostly negative between period 1990 and 2007. This is as a result of inefficient renewable technologies during the period. However, there is persistent and positive influence of REC on economic growth in the period between 2009 and 2015. Increase use of renewable technologies due to its relative affordability and better efficiency contributes to the progressive influence on economic growth. The variance decomposition analysis predicts an increase in the use of renewable energy technologies in the five year forecast period, with CO2 emissions will increasing as a consequence of dependence fossil fuel energy resources.

We propose a supply chain inventory model with controllable deterioration and emission rates under payment schemes for shortage and surplus, where demand depends on price and trade credit. Carbon emissions and deterioration are factors affecting global warming, and many greenhouse managers have focused on reducing carbon emissions. Carbon caps and tax-based incentives have been used in many green-houses to achieve such reduction. Because of the importance of reducing carbon emissions for developing a green supply chain, various studies have investigated how firms deal with carbon emission constraints. In this continuation, we have used green technology to curb the excessive emissions from the environment or make it clean from CO2. In a seller\\xe2\\x80\\x93buyer relationship, the seller can offer a trade credit period to the buyer to manage stock and stimulate demand. Deterioration may become a challenge for most firms as they are under time constraints control, and preservation technology could help. This study proposes three novel inventory strategies for a sustainable supply chain (full backorder, partial backorder, and no backorder), linking all these important issues. The solution optimizes total annual profit for inventory shortage or surplus. We conducted a numerical study with three examples to evaluate the model\\xe2\\x80\\x99s authenticity and effectiveness and demonstrate the solution technique. The deterioration and emission rates can be included in a trade credit policy to increase greenhouse profits.

Legume crop residues and green manures are rich in nitrogen due to mutualistic rhizobia, bacteria that live in their roots and convert atmospheric nitrogen into a biologically available form. Growers can obtain recommendations from local extension offices about how much less inorganic nitrogen fertilizer needs to be added to a subsequent crop following different legume break crops for the predominant soil type (the nitrogen fertilizer replacement value, or NFRV). Due to the intimate relationship between legumes and rhizobia, conditions that affect plant health can also affect the rhizobia and how much nitrogen they provide. We use a combination of empirical data and previously published values to estimate reductions in nitrogen inputs under outbreaks of plant viruses of varying severity. We also use historical fertilizer prices to examine the economic impacts of this lost fertilizer for farmers. We find that fertilizer losses are greatest for crops that fix large amounts of nitrogen, such as clover and alfalfa as opposed to common bean. The economic impact on farmers is controlled by the proportion of plants with viral infections and the price of synthetic fertilizer. In a year of high disease prevalence, attention is normally focused on the yield of the diseased crops. We suggest that farmers growing legumes as break crops should be concerned about yields of subsequent crops as well. Viral diseases can be difficult to diagnose in the field, so the easiest way for farmers to prevent unexpected yield losses in subsequent crops is to test their soil when it is feasible to do so. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 Ecological Society of America\"\\n\"Yin W., Zhu Z., Kirkulak-Uludag B., Zhu Y.\",\"The determinants of green credit and its impact on the performance of Chinese banks\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096399805&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2020.124991&partnerID=40&md5=6f07cdbde0c424e049b63d9738f507b6\",\"This paper investigates the determinants of the green credit ratio (GCR), and the impact of green credits on the profitability and credit risk of Chinese banks.

Moreover, green lending practices have a significant impact on the profitability and risk faced by these banks. One of the most striking findings of this paper is that while green lending increases the profitability of non-state-owned banks and reduces their risk, state-owned banks provide green credits at the expense of their profitability.

This comparative analysis of two prominent ESMs in Oregon finds that these institutions can severely restrict opportunities for public participation in land-use decision making, reduce the transparency of measurement technologies used to target restoration activities, and prioritize privately owned land outside of urban areas for restoration investments, thereby limiting public access to green spaces. \\xc2\\xa9 The Author(s) 2018.\"\\n\"Feng Q., Wang Y., Chen C., Dong Z., Shi X.\",\"Effect of Homebuyer Comment on Green Housing Purchase Intention\\xe2\\x80\\x94Mediation Role of Psychological Distance\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102278653&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2021.568451&partnerID=40&md5=06121321c7b4ef1b68f2bfb8afba1b6a\",\"Green housing is a new type of building that advocates energy saving and environmental protection. How to stimulate buyers to buy green housing under the background of high cost is the key problem to guide green consumption. First of all, based on the existing literature, the comment of homebuyers was divided into comment quantity, comment quality, comment titer and evaluator credibility. The psychological distance mediation variable was introduced, and three dimensions of time distance, social distance, and space distance were selected to construct the influence model of homebuyer comment on green housing purchase intention. Meanwhile, the concept model was built, and questionnaires were adopted for empirical analysis. On this basis, considering the long-term purchase behavior of buyers, the influence model of homebuyers\\' second comment on green housing purchase intention with the Hotelling model was established. The results show that comment quality, comment titer, and the credit rating of the evaluator have a positive effect on green housing purchase intention while comment quantity has no significant effect. Psychological distance plays a mediation role between comment quality, comment titer, the credit rating of the evaluator, and green housing purchase intention while having a mediation effect between comment quantity and green housing purchase intention. In the long-term purchase behavior of green housing, psychological distance plays a greater role than price. At last, some suggestions were proposed. \\xc2\\xa9 Copyright \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Feng, Wang, Chen, Dong and Shi.\"\\n\"Prajapati D., Paul D., Malik S., Mishra D.K.\",\"Understanding the preference of individual retail investors on green bond in India: An empirical study\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101575788&doi=10.21511%2fimfi.18%281%29.2021.15&partnerID=40&md5=e6bc5f8ecf0f72715e620bff0949e883\",\"The biggest challenge facing countries, including India, is creating and managing an LCR (low carbon resilient) economy, which balances the need for high growth rates and is environmentally sustainable.

This study aims to identify the CP practices adopted by different sizes of companies in the textile sector located in Brazil. A survey was conducted, and answers were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test to assess the relevance of each CP practice according to company size. The results showed that small companies apply CP practices exclusively for economic benefit because they have financial difficulties and lack of credit, medium-sized companies are challenged by large supply chains to achieve an environmental management system to provide products and services, and large companies seek green certifications to export their products to the European market. The results contribute to business practices by facilitating identification of the most relevant CP practices for each company size. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

TTD theory has the potential to address many unresolved challenges associated with predicting pollutant fate and transport through these systems, including unsteadiness in the water balance (time-varying inflows, outflows, and storage), unsteadiness in pollutant loading, time-dependent reactions, and scale-up to GSI networks and urban catchments. From a solution to the unsteady age conservation equation under uniform sampling, we derive an explicit expression for solute breakthrough during and after one or more storm events. The solution is calibrated and validated with breakthrough data from 17 simulated storms at a field-scale biofilter test facility in Southern California, using bromide as a conservative tracer. TTD theory closely reproduces bromide breakthrough concentrations, provided that lateral exchange with the surrounding soil is accounted for. At any given time, according to theory, more than half of the water in storage is from the most recent storm, while the rest is a mixture of penultimate and earlier storms. Thus, key management endpoints, such as the pollutant treatment credit attributable to GSI, are likely to depend on the evolving age distribution of water stored and released by these systems. \\xc2\\xa9 2020.

Empirical evidence also shows that the GCG2012 significantly reduces bank credit but increases trade credit. Consequently, the substitution hypothesis is established. Furthermore, GCG2012 has reduced the allocation efficiency of bank credit within energy-intensive industries. As an improved green credit policy to encourage enterprises to invest in energy efficiency, the Energy Efficiency Credit Guidelines in 2015 (EECG2015) increases both the bank credit and the fixed asset investment, whereas no increase in R&D intensity or TFP is found.

The study found that in terms of loan volume, the launch of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreen Credit Guidelines\\xe2\\x80\\x9d enabled green enterprises to obtain more credit resources than polluters. In terms of financing cost, green credit policy means green enterprises obtain lower financing cost than polluters.

The results show that for enterprises with different property rights, the effect of green credit policy on non-state-owned enterprises is more significant than that of state-owned enterprises. For enterprises in different regions, the policy effect of green credit policy on enterprises in regions with relatively backward economic development levels is more significant than that of enterprises in regions with relatively developed economic development level.

In 2017, the City of Lancaster entered into a Consent Decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the US Department of Justice, and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to prepare an amended Long Term Control Plan that included, amongst other items, green infrastructure program plans and manuals \\xe2\\x80\\x93 specifically development of a Green Infrastructure Design Manual, Green Infrastructure Operation and Maintenance Plan, and Green Infrastructure Monitoring Plan. The Green Infrastructure Design Manual serves as a technical reference for the design of both public GI installations implemented by the City and private GI installations associated with land development activities and/or stormwater fee credits. The manual provides technical guidance for the planning, design, and construction of individual GI systems by type including bioretention/bioinfiltration (i.e., rain gardens, stormwater planters, stormwater bumpouts), porous pavement, green roofs, subsurface infiltration (including stormwater tree trenches) and detention, cisterns, and naturalized basins. The Green Infrastructure Operations and Maintenance Plan allows the City and private property owners to plan for and conduct effective O&M throughout the useful life of the systems. The Green Infrastructure Monitoring Plan includes GI monitoring methodologies, asset maintenance data schema, programmatic workflows (forms, logs, and procedures), staffing, and record keeping in addition to maintenance tasks (standard maintenance and inspection procedures, maintenance scheduling, and budget requirements). Guidance is geared toward a professional audience (i.e., staff engineers, landscape architects, environmental scientists) but uses charts, tables, and graphics for simplicity and readability. The Green Infrastructure Monitoring Plan was developed in coordination with the City and its GI Performance Evaluation Strategy. The plan includes monitoring planning and development of objectives, site selection and monitoring strategy, preparation of Quality Assurance Project Plans (QAPPs), and preparation of the monitoring plan. In the two years since the development of these guidance manuals, the City has implemented their use for all new and existing green infrastructure projects, standardizing designs and maintenance protocols, including adaptive management strategies, and implementing a comprehensive monitoring program. This includes developing training standards for their staff to perform acceptance testing and performance monitoring for compliance. This following will include detailed examples for each of the three elements of the project, provide guidance on lessons learned from initial GI installations to current revised facilities, and provide a forum for discussion/feedback on best practices for GI design, O&M and monitoring that can help build a comprehensive GI management program.

This evaluation is based on WELL v2 tool. The energy performance assessment is achieved by Design Builder software which allows creating the reference point building (building complying with ASHRAE 90.1 standards). The results show that energy consumption of the studied building is 220.75 kWh/m2. While for the reference building, the energy consumption is estimated to 277.7 kWh/m2. Therefore, the achieved savings of 20.5% consents attainment of a relevant score of 9 points according to the LEED v4 reference. The environmental impacts are evaluated using the attributional Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) approach by means of: OneClick LCA software, ecoinvent, GaBi database and the CML method. The Carbon footprint of the baseline construction showing results is numerically higher with an estimated value of 58.79 kg CO2e/m2/year while the proposed building was estimated at 15.58 kg CO2e /m2/year. according to the results of the analysis of the building\\'s life cycle impact, the energy consumption can greatly increase ADP-Fossil results that achieve a score of 3 points according to the MR Credit 3 of LEED v4 tool. In addition, according to WELL v2, we note that the notion of sustainability is strongly present at the level of the educational building in Ifrane. In this scope, the building is obtaining a score of 1 point for concept L03, 1 point for L08, 3 points for V03, 2 points for V06, 2 points for V08 and 2 points for M09. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 IEEE.\"\\n\"Havenstein A., Ruber K., Harrison M., Doolan C.\",\"Acoustic Technique for Building Envelope Air Permeability Test\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128068312&partnerID=40&md5=ca32b469d309fdc430fad3e684334cee\",\"Buildings are an enormous consumer of energy, due to air leaks alone buildings waste up to 5% of all energy worldwide. Building envelope airtightness is therefore of paramount importance to minimise energy consumption and to meet cut carbon emissions by 2050, as set out by the Australian Government. Air permeability rate testing is also becoming a requirement for various building rating systems such as WELL and Green Star and must be performed to obtain the relevant credit points. The commonly used current standard measuring technique for air permeability is the blower door test, while thermography and smoke pens are widely used for air leak detection. All these methods have in common, that a difference of either pressure or temperature between inside and outside of the building must be established. Moreover, the blower door test is labour and time intensive. To meet the demand for increased building airtightness and testing, more efficient methods are needed. Following the principle that sound travels the same path as leaking air, acoustic based techniques are proposed. Among those techniques the acoustic imaging shows best potential benefits.

However, due to the vagaries in the prevailing climate at a project site, passive measures are limited in their ability to ascertain an optimal use of natural resources available at the project site, while also working under certain circumstances against the provision of adequate indoor environmental conditions. The purpose of this project is to showcase the automation of passive measures by an automated daylighting and shading device for vertical glazed surfaces, which has the main objective of increasing daylight in a space while preventing direct sunlight from penetrating the space. During the year and throughout the day the solar azimuth and elevation is constantly changing which makes it of utmost importance for the device to be able to modulate and adapt to the changing solar azimuth and elevation angles. As the position of the sun changes throughout the day and over the course of the whole year; the blinds and shading equipment often have to be adjusted manually by the user at different times of the day. If this is not done, direct sunlight may enter the building and heat the space which results in a higher cooling load. Moreover, direct sunlight can cause glare problems. The proposed mechatronics system orients itself automatically based on the solar azimuth and elevation angles with respect to the particular orientation of the fa\\xc3\\xa7ade it is installed on. It also monitors the ambient light levels in the room and controls the artificial light accordingly. The system can be used in two modes; the overhang and the louver position, hence providing an all-in-one external shading device for glazed surfaces to deal with low, medium and high angle sun, and hence brings the much-needed flexibility to control heat gains through glazing. Research findings show that modulating the heat gains admitted through the glazing can have a significant influence on influencing the indoor thermal conditions, hence lending credit to the proposed system. It is also equipped with a WIFI module and a user interface to allow the user to control the system manually. The implementation and testing of the prototype provided conclusive results for the daylight monitoring, manual control and automatic control. \\xc2\\xa9 IEEE 2022.\"\\n\"Alhosani A.H., Humayun N.-U.-D., Kannan J.\",\"Emission Capping & Trading, First of its Kind in ADNOC Group\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127700400&doi=10.2118%2f207885-MS&partnerID=40&md5=36fb848dde114c3e9ef438409d555872\",\"The Spiking Gas Compressor project was installed in 2014, which reduces 65,000 tons of Carbondi-oxide (CO2) emission annually. This was subsequently registered as a CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) project under UN convention and incidentally this was the first ADNOC project to be under this registration. The registration is the first step to claim for Carbon Credits under United Nations Framework of Clean Climate Convention (UNFCCC) scheme. No Carbon Credits were claimed under CDM since its commissioning in 2014 due to low carbon price. In 2019, we achieved the next big milestone of trading these accumulated carbon credits to an Austrian MNC. M/s MASDAR, pioneer in this field, who are also partner of ADNOC onshore in this green project, arranged an Upstream Emission Reduction (UER) buyer. The transaction is worth 65,000 tons of CO2 reduction and considerable monetary benefit. This transaction assumes significance not in terms of monetary value but a global recognition to ADNOC as a company amongst the leading players in the global arena in reducing the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. This project is the first &amp; largest Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) registered in Oil &amp; Gas industry in UAE.

The sample includes 40 countries in Europe and data is collected on a large set of variables, for the years from 1990 to 2019. Financial development is measured through domestic credit to the private sector, bank credit to the private sector and foreign direct investment (FDI). Environmental degradation is measured through energy use, CO2 emissions, greenhouse emissions and natural resource depletion. The model controls for income levels, institutional quality, technology, education, population, and urbanization. Regression analysis is conducted to analyze the data. The results suggest that financial development has a negative relationship with four different measures of environmental degradation, while FDI and institutional quality appear to worsen the environmental measures. Recommendations for policy makers include development of green finance policies and strong institutions, to lower environmental degradation in the long run. \\xc2\\xa9 2022 The Author(s).

This article investigates the use of one specific monetary policy tool, namely window guidance, by the Peoples\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Bank of China (PBC) and the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) to encourage financial institutions to expand credit to sustainable activities and curb lending to heavy-polluting industries. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Window guidance\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is a relatively informal policy instrument that uses benevolent compulsion to \\xe2\\x80\\x98guide\\xe2\\x80\\x99 financial institutions to extend credit and allocate lending in line with official (government) targets. We investigate window guidance targets for the period 2001\\xe2\\x80\\x932020 and find that \\xe2\\x80\\x98green\\xe2\\x80\\x99 targets were included by the CBRC from at least 2006 and by the PBC from 2007 to discourage lending to carbon-intensive and polluting industries and/or to increase support to sustainable activities. In 2014, both authorities stopped discouraging lending to carbon-intensive/polluting industries through window guidance. Sustainable objectives were subsequently also removed from the PBC\\'s list of window guidance priority sectors at the start of 2019, ending the practice of green window guidance in China. Sustainability-enhancing window guidance targets were replaced and formalized through new \\xe2\\x80\\x98Guidelines for Establishing the Green Financial System\\xe2\\x80\\x99, reflecting efforts to move away from controls-based towards market-based policy instruments. Based on this analysis, the article draws four lessons for the design of green finance policies for other countries that seek to enhance sustainable finance and mitigate climate change and related risks. Key policy insights The Chinese experience of using window guidance to direct bank lending to support national sustainability targets and goals shows how the instrument can be successfully used in financial markets that are at an early stage of financial market development. The efficacy of window guidance and other directed bank-lending policies is likely to diminish as financial markets mature and direct monetary policy instruments become less powerful. When window guidance is used, it should be linked to clear criteria of success, the achievement of which should be monitored. Green window guidance should be embedded in a broader framework of green finance policies, as well as climate and environmental policies. While today\\'s framing and language on sustainable finance policy in China focuses increasingly on market-based instruments, the Chinese experience of using window guidance offers valuable lessons for other emerging economies in Asia and beyond with financial systems dominated by banks. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\"\\n\"Wasan P., Kumar A., Luthra S.\",\"Green Finance Barriers and Solution Strategies for Emerging Economies: The Case of India\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120041679&doi=10.1109%2fTEM.2021.3123185&partnerID=40&md5=f11f60483b67d88c0be9a45fbefcc04d\",\"The need to increase green developers&#x2019; access to finance is critical and urgent for emerging economies that are currently facing an annual green financing gap of &#x0024;2.5&#x00A0;trillion. This article investigates barriers and strategies for promoting green finance (hereafter GF) in India which is one of the fastest emerging economies globally. The article uses a two-phase methodology. In the first phase, an exhaustive literature survey followed by a three-round modified Delphi method is used to extract significant barriers and solution strategies for GF adoption. In the second phase, the best worst method is used to rank the barriers using their relative weights, and the solution strategies by utilizing global weights as input. The article finds that policy, economic, and knowledge barriers are the top three barriers for GF adoption. Clear green policies and risk assessment frameworks; credit enhancement mechanisms for green developers; low-cost refinancing and securitization markets for green technology and products; and combining directed finance with incentivized finance, public finance with private finance, and financial markets with technology are some of the most important strategies obtained from this article for promoting GF adoption.

The entire plant can be used for either human or livestock consumption and with considerable drought-tolerating capacity. Tender young leaves, green pods and matured seeds are used as human food. Moreover, the crop serves for sustainable soil fertility improvement due to its excellent nitrogenfixing capacity. However, its production and utilization are limited in Ethiopia partly due to dependence on the conventional agronomic practices and lack of information on its wide ranging uses. This study was conducted to assess the cowpea agronomy and the contributions the crop has in the livelihoods of farmers at Loka-Abaya and Humbo districts of Southern Ethiopia. Multi-stage sampling techniques were employed to achieve the set objectives. Both primary and secondary data were collected to solicit the required information. The data were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics such as multiple linear regression model using the SPSS Software version 20 and STATA 13. Multiple linear regression model results showed that education, land size, climate information access, credit access, lack of market chain, availability of seed of improved varieties, and pests significantly (P<0.001) affected cowpea production in the studied areas. The trend analysis showed that the cowpea yield and production area coverage is increasing in Humbo District whereas, a decreasing trend was observed at the Loka Abaya. According to the household interview data, about 76 % of the respondents reported a decrease in the cultivated area of cowpea. According to the respondents, lack of access to improved seed and lack of extension support services contributed 79 % and 73 %, respectively to the low yield observed in the area. The majority of the respondents cultivate cowpea as intercropping and rotation with cereals and in the main field with the main purpose to replenish soil fertility (97 %). On the other hand, 62 % of the respondents cultivate cowpea for home consumption. According to the survey result, 48 % of the respondents use the matured grain for consumption. The production trends of the cowpea are highly variable mainly due to less attention paid by the extension systems to boost the yield of the crop, reliance of farmers on local varieties, pest occurrence and poor market chain. Therefore, modern production technologies including the supply of improved varieties of seed with their full production package should be introduced to the area so as to improve the yield and optimize its contribution towards achieving food security \\xc2\\xa9 2021.

This study employs Critical Interpretive Synthesis to examine the evidence on Aboriginal mothering through DFV. Serrant-Green\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Silences Framework was used to structure the critique, understand its problematics and generate an argument to counter the evidential silence. From 6,117 search results, ten publications were reviewed, only four of which substantially addressed Aboriginal mothering in the context of family and domestic violence; a conspicuous absence from the literature about Aboriginal women, children, and mothering. Studies addressing Aboriginal women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experience of DFV did not credit the issue of mothering. Equally, studies that did address mothering through violence were generally not inclusive of Aboriginal women. Silence, therefore, sits at the nexus of DFV, Aboriginal women, and mothering. While violence against Aboriginal women is acknowledged as a social ill, inattention to mothering in research represents a disregard for Aboriginal women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mothering identities and roles.

LEED prerequisites and credits are achieved by employing sustainable strategies. The efficiency and success of some of these strategies are dependent on future occupant behaviors. As occupant behaviors shape their building\\'s energy-use, resource-use, and waste production, this paper aims to understand whether the achievement of LEED credits shapes occupant pro-environmental behaviors (energy-saving, resource-saving, and sustainable waste management). People spend the majority of their time at work; therefore, this paper takes the work environment as its setting. Further, it explores occupant behaviors in one LEED-certified (CAE) and one non-LEED-certified (ABBE) office building. Occupant surveys extract self-reported energy-saving, resource-saving, and sustainable waste management behaviors of building occupants in both settings. Results reveal a possible impact of LEED credit (SSc4.1) on commute behaviors and (M + R prerequisite) on sustainable waste management behaviors in LEED-certified building occupants. Results showed insignificant differences in both populations in terms of resource-saving behaviors. Further, a negatively significant difference was found in energy-saving behaviors of LEED-certified building occupants which were possibly influenced by limiting building policy. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\"\\n\"Aquije C., Schmidt H.-P., Draper K., Joseph S., Ladd B.\",\"Low tech biochar production could be a highly effective nature-based solution for climate change mitigation in the developing world\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116260420&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-021-05159-6&partnerID=40&md5=e5c1dd86d251edd6525bb90e3f7cfc0d\",\"Aim: To compare the climate change mitigation benefits of nature-based solutions for management of municipal green waste with conventional management. Methods: This study analyzed the carbon footprint of managing one ton of municipal green waste (MGW) in Lima Peru under 4 different scenarios: 1) Final disposal in authorized landfill, 2) Final disposal in informal landfill, 3) composting and 4) biochar production using a low-cost, low tech Kon-Tiki reactor. Results: The results demonstrate the very clear potential for climate change mitigation from biochar production using low tech and therefore accessible technology in a typical developing world context. The carbon footprint of producing biochar was lower than for composting and biochar and compost both had carbon footprints significantly lower than landfilling. Conclusion: We argue that the standards used by nascent platforms for trading carbon removal credits generated by biochar should relax the technology requirement to favor engagement and participation of small-scale market participants in low-income countries. Waste management in the developing world presents significant challenges but often starts from a very low base which means there is large potential for reducing emissions, as well as for sequestering carbon. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\"\\n\"Moura N., Guedes J., Cavalcante E., Oliveira M., Maia A., Castro A., Moreira E., Cardoso D., Sampaio V.\",\"Landscape Information Modelling to Improve Feedback in the Geodesign International Collaboration for Carbon Credit Enhancement in Metropolitan Regions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The Case Study of Fortaleza, Brazil\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115734257&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-86979-3_29&partnerID=40&md5=a904573d5af0369bff79faf3caa297bc\",\"Better landscape designs demand better landscape analysis and vice versa.

As a participant of the International Geodesign Collaboration (IGC) workshop \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrees for Metropolitan Regions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, this research has been developed for the Metropolitan Region of Fortaleza (MRF), the 6th largest in Brazil, located on the Northeast coast, and aimed at increasing green areas for Carbon Credit (CC) purposes. This methodological research achieved a script for subsequently information modelling application, which will improve precision in the achievement and evaluation of pre-established goals. Six methodological steps accomplished a selection of data for latter parametric modelling: 1. Reading enrichment and definition of the planning concept; 2. Division of the metropolitan region into Landscape Units (LU); 3. Selection of squared cut out samples for each LU; 4. Proposition of innovative solutions; 5. Design for CC increment through conservation, expansion, and creation of green areas; 6. Evaluation of CC enhancement and feedback. For the fifth step, three future scenarios have been designed, in 2035 and 2050: the traditional, the late adopter and the early adopter. Replicating designed green areas from samples to their respective LU resulted in a total CC increase of 33.19% for the traditional scenario, 44.29% for the late adopter and 87.71% for the early adopter, all for 2050, which goal has been established by the IGC at 30%. Information modelling, using the identified parameters in this work, may review, accelerate and improve these results. This improvement will be enhanced when precision of sample recognition is increased to define smaller cut out squares. With opportunities of resources for data processing and design, information modelling allows the design of samples on microscale to feedback regional planning, which leads to adaptive goals and to develop a valuable tool for integration among multiple scales through Landscape Information Modeling (LIM). \\xc2\\xa9 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\"\\n\"Huang Y.\",\"Construction and Analysis of Green Investment Risk Evaluation Index System Based on Information Entropy Fuzzy Hierarchical Analysis Model\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115055157&doi=10.1155%2f2021%2f4850321&partnerID=40&md5=d541962389bfcd4f68d192421ced9d04\",\"This paper adopts the information entropy fuzzy hierarchical analysis model to conduct an in-depth study and analysis of the green investment risk evaluation system and to process and analyze its indicators. The entropy method-fuzzy hierarchical analysis is used to evaluate the green financial capital operation risk. Firstly, I point out the research trends and shortcomings, define the concepts of fund operation, operation risk, risk evaluation, and green finance, and elaborate the relevant basic theories to lay the theoretical foundation for the later research; secondly, I identify the external and internal fund operation risks by describing the development plan, overall operation, and specific operation plan of green finance; then, according to the existing fund operation risks, I integrate commercial banks\\' risk. Then, based on the existing fund operation risks, I integrate the risk types of commercial banks, combine the characteristics of green finance business, design the green finance fund operation risk evaluation index system, initially determine the index weights through hierarchical analysis method, introduce the entropy value method to improve the index weights, and use the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to obtain the final evaluation results: in the process of green finance fund operation, internal risk is the most important risk, among which credit risk and financial innovation risk have the most significant impact; external risk is the second most important risk, among which economic risk and political risk are the most important. External risks are the second most important risks, among which economic risks and political risks are more obvious. The risks are judged from single-factor aspects, and the scoring values are used to determine the higher possibility of schedule risks caused by human factors, and finally, the schedule risk level of the reservoir project is determined to be medium through a comprehensive evaluation. The reasonableness of the calculation results shows that the entropy theory and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method are still applicable to the assessment of green investment risks. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Yuqi Huang.\"\\n\"Cousins J.J., Hill D.T.\",\"Green infrastructure, stormwater, and the financialization of municipal environmental governance\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114901894&doi=10.1080%2f1523908X.2021.1893164&partnerID=40&md5=ae6b11161a6d088bd5a6953b2325b175\",\"Municipalities large and small are grappling with how to address enduring water quality challenges stemming from the impermeability of much of the built environment and how to address shifting precipitation patterns due to climate change. Finding ways to fund and finance the redesign, retrofit, and adaptation of the built environment, however, presents a major obstacle in an environment of municipal fiscal austerity. In this paper, we examine how municipalities are adopting different fee structures and financial tools to pay for stormwater abatement through green and gray infrastructure and improve their capacity to deal with the impacts of climate change. Drawing on a survey of 233 municipalities and interviews with municipal leaders, we show that transitioning towards green infrastructure in municipal stormwater and climate change planning is a broad goal among most respondents, but stormwater fee systems are typically not sufficient for meeting regulatory mandates as well as the operation and maintenance costs needed to replace or repair urban water infrastructure. This shortfall has led many municipalities to use a host of other financial tools, such as credit and mitigation banking and social impact and green bonds. We suggest this shift has important implications for achieving sustainability and ensuring just transitions. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\"\\n\"Nouman M., Khan D., Ul Haq I., Naz N., Zahra B.T.E., Ullah A.\",\"Assessing the implication of green revolution for food security in Pakistan: A multivariate cointegration decomposition analysis\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114651694&doi=10.1002%2fpa.2758&partnerID=40&md5=45f4ace25cc81de3b1de9ec3ef00020a\",\"Food security is a growing concern around the world and the agricultural sector plays a significant role in solving this problem to a large extent.

Further, lean six sigma has been used to identify causes and propose remedies for the losses that were identified in the former technique. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\"\\n\"Zhang Q., Xu L., Wang K., Shi X.\",\"What effect did the Green Credit Policy have on China\\'s energy or emission intensive firms?\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110018419&doi=10.1108%2fIJOEM-04-2021-0555&partnerID=40&md5=fb92b8cb648a4449af5f17fe62d56cf5\",\"Purpose: The role of energy or emission intensive firms face contradictory demands from advancing economic development and environmental improvement and protection and thus require appropriate policy interventions to balance the two needs. China\\'s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreen Credit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d policy that restricts loans to energy or emission intensive firms provides an example to study the impact of these kinds of policy intervention. Design/methodology/approach: Using the data of all A-share listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, our paper empirically analyzes the impact of the Green Credit Policy on performance of these energy or emission intensive firms. Findings: (1) Using difference-in-difference (DID) and propensity score matching (PSM)-DID method and the dynamic effect method, we found that from 2012 to 2015, the Green Credit Policy had an inhibiting effect on the performance of energy or emission intensive firms. This inhibiting effect was gradually weakened in 2016, and it turned into a positive promoting effect in 2017; (2) The performance\\'s change of these firms around 2015 showed that Green Credit promoted the green transformation and upgrading of these firms; (3) Loans were helpful to the performance of energy or emission intensive firms to some extent, but government subsidies were not significant. Originality/value: The results suggest that the government, banks and other institutions should dynamically assess the implementation results of the Green Credit Policy on energy or emission intensive firms. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.\"\\n\"Chen Z., Sarkar A., Li X., Xia X.\",\"Effects of joint adoption for multiple green production technologies on welfare-a survey of 650 kiwi growers in Shaanxi and Sichuan\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109950523&doi=10.1108%2fIJCCSM-06-2020-0054&partnerID=40&md5=ffba5a0ad1dfa1c4b02434d13132938f\",\"Purpose: Based on the survey data of 650 kiwi growers from Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces, this paper used multiple endogenous transformation regression models to explore the effect of the joint adoption of green production technology on farmer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s welfare. The purpose of the study is to analyze the influence of green production technology on the yield, household income and socioeconomic characteristics of Kiwi fruit growers. Design/methodology/approach: In the context of the study, multiple endogenous transformation model (MESR) are adopted, but self-actualization tactics were adopted to deal with the instrumental variables. The empirical data has been collected via a combined hierarchical sampling and random sampling, whereas a well-structured Likert scale questionnaire was adopted as well. The empirical data has been processed with the help of STATA 15.1 version. Findings: The study found a positive impact of adopting green production technology. Moreover, the joint adoption of green production technology by kiwi growers has significantly increased the yield, economic values of Kiwi and household income of kiwi farmers. The households with higher asset value, better land quality, weaker credit constraints, more technical training and stronger government promotion and support from local governments are the most likely to adopt pest control technology and soil management technology jointly.

Through simulation analysis, the primary factors affecting the choice of game strategy and the stable strategy under different conditions are discussed. The results show that the strategic choices of the government, ESCOs, banks, and owners influence each other in the two game models. Government regulations will have an impact on the strategic choices of ESCOs, banks, and owners. The owners\\' strategy choice is closely related to the perceived benefits and costs of retrofitting.

The participatory countries of the Paris Agreement agreed to align finance flows with a low-emission, low-carbon and climate-resilient growth, in order to facilitate achieving the long-term climate goals. The financial sector, therefore, needs to play a proactive role in aligning financial flows. It is, therefore, of utmost importance to study low-carbon finance and climate-related financial risks. This chapter examine how climate change can affect the financial sector. It discusses the concept, nature, measurement of climate risks and climate-related financial risks and associated prospects and challenges in the assessment and the measurement of these risks. It also presents the green financing initiatives and role of central banks and supervisory authorities and their monetary and financial policies in enhancing green financing and redirecting finance to low-carbon activities. In the financial sector, the insurance industry is highly vulnerable to such risks. The banking sector is yet to witness the serious impact of these risks.

This paper focuses on a green supply chain consisting of a supplier and a manufacturer and considers two financing schemes wherein the manufacturer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operating capital and green innovation capital are both constrained: bank credit financing (BCF) and supplier green investment (SGI). We investigate the financing strategy of a manufacturer with different financing decision preferences and supply chain coordination contract designs. The results show that when the manufacturer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financing decision preference is low bankruptcy risk, it should choose BCF when the bank loan interest rate is lower than a threshold and SGI when the bank loan interest rate is higher than this threshold; when the manufacturer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financing decision preference is high R&D benefit, it should choose BCF when the initial capital is lower than another threshold and choose SGI when the initial capital is higher than this threshold. Then, we compare whether cost-sharing, quantity discount and revenue-sharing contracts can coordinate the supply chain, and discuss the selection strategies of supply chain members for coordination contracts. Research shows that revenue-sharing contracts fail to coordinate; however, when the cost-sharing ratio and quantity discount rate are appropriate, both cost-sharing and quantity discount contracts can achieve supply chain coordination. The lower the supplier\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unit production cost, the stronger its motivation to accept a higher cost-sharing ratio and quantity discount rate. For the supplier, the key to choosing any coordination contract lies in the relative height of the cost-sharing ratio and quantity discount rate while the manufacturer should always choose a quantity discount contract when the quantity discount rate is high enough. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.\"\\n\"Chen W., Wu Y.\",\"China\\'s New Environmental Protection Law and Green Innovation: Evidence from Prefecture-Level Cities\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107206882&doi=10.1155%2f2021%2f5566357&partnerID=40&md5=965a9e7289038136813fd9ad53c0d22e\",\"This paper examines the impact of China\\'s new environmental protection law on green innovation. Using a large sample of Chinese prefecture-level cities for the 2010-2016 period and the difference-in-differences (DID) methodology, we provide strong evidence that the new environmental protection law promotes green innovation. This finding is robust to a battery of sensitivity tests. The micromechanism analysis shows that the new environmental protection law can promote green innovation by imposing stricter financial constraints on enterprises in high-pollution industries and increasing their incentives for green innovation to meet green credit requirements. Further, we find that the impact of the new environmental protection law on green innovation is more prominent in prefecture-level cities with a lower level of banking competition and for prefecture-level cities with stronger intellectual property protection. Overall, these findings suggest that the new environmental protection law has played an important role in promoting green innovation in China. To improve the effect of the new environmental protection law on green innovation, the government can consider lowering banking competition and strengthening intellectual property protection. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Wen Chen and Ying Wu.\"\\n\"Yoshino N., Yuyama T.\",\"ESG/Green investment and allocation of portfolio assets\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107058451&doi=10.25115%2feea.v39i3.4628&partnerID=40&md5=fdd57a64f7ebb35b35e51a478214c11d\",\"This article examines the current portfolio allocation in ESG and Green projects.

The aim of the study is to generalize and systematize the results of scientific research on the participation of banks in financing the green economy. In the context of the historical approach, the authors apply the methods of critical analysis, logical generalization, systematization, and grouping.

The authors concluded that responsible banking is moving towards the transformation of classic products and services into environmentally and socially oriented ones, accompanied by the transformation of business processes, management culture, and the content of banking policy. Responsible banking contributes to ensuring financial stability, but the regulator needs to use macroprudential tools to timely identify a green credit bubble, including through climate and environmental stress testing. prospects for further research are aimed at assessing the impact of green financial instruments on the bank\\'s performance, the role of responsible banking in achieving sustainable development goals, at finding the most effective monetary and macroprudential tools to stimulate responsible banking and ensure financial stability. \\xc2\\xa9 Miroshnichenko O.S., Brand N.A., 2021\"\\n\"Billio M., Costola M., Pelizzon L., Riedel M.\",\"Buildings\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Energy Efficiency and the Probability of Mortgage Default: The Dutch Case\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105872373&doi=10.1007%2fs11146-021-09838-0&partnerID=40&md5=55e172663e038ad310984c5b1ce47cd9\",\"We investigate the relationship between building energy efficiency and the probability of mortgage default. To this end, we construct a novel panel data set by combining Dutch loan-level mortgage information with provisional building energy ratings provided by the Netherlands Enterprise Agency. Using the logit regression and the extended Cox model, we find that building energy efficiency is associated with a lower probability of mortgage default. There are three possible channels that might drive the results: (i) personal borrower characteristics captured by the choice of an energy-efficient building, (ii) improvements in building performance that could help to free-up the borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disposable income, and (iii) improvements in dwelling value that lower the loan-to-value ratio.

The massive task with the various power control functions in computercomponents was made to minimize energy consumption. Increasing consumption of energy in data serverenvironments means that data centers will have high maintenance costs. Various geo-distributed datacenters are starting to grow in an age of data proliferation and information growth. Energy management for servers is now demanded for technological, environmental, and economic reasons. In this environment, the main memory is a major energy consumer, not less than the processor. At the same time, an energy-efficient task scheduling strategy is a viable way to meet these goals. Unfortunately, mapping Virtual Machine (VM) resources to the Main Memory (MM) demands to achieve good performance by minimizing the energy consumption within a certain limit is a huge challenge. This paper simulates energy-efficient task scheduling algorithms in a heterogeneous virtualized environment using real-time virtual machine scheduling to resolve the issue of energy consumption. Using a simulator Real-Time system SIMulator (RTSIM), several hardware-based scheduling algorithms are implemented to observe VM memory scheduling efficiency to save memory energy. The simulation results show that, compared to current energy-efficient scheduling methods Rate Monotonic (RM), Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF), and Least-Laxity-First (LLF), helps to reduce energy consumption and improve performance. It is also observed that memory-aware energy management architecture reduces energy and memory consumption efficiently by using EDF scheduling algorithms. In particular, EDF saves approximately 58.3 percent of memory energy than conventional systems that cannot benefit from memory-aware energy management algorithms. The energy efficiency of the algorithms continues to improve as the level of server consolidation rises. We also implemented the EDF scheduling algorithm in Xen\\'s Credit scheduler to see if the simulation outcomes can be simulated on physical systems. Results of simulation and deployment are equated, and comparable outcomes are achieved. We also identified that shared memory between virtual machines deliberately affects memory\\'s energy consumption based on the implementation. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 IEEE.\"\\n\"Iyer P.S., Mazumdar R.\",\"EXIM Bank of India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Support for Food Security and Capacity Building in Africa\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103111368&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-54112-5_14&partnerID=40&md5=8e6f1e410c00f991978d1b4af4a5b2ed\",\"Despite the availability of large tracts of cultivable land, Africa is unable to meet its basic food needs due to inter alia; scarce water resources, inadequate agri-infrastructure, inefficiencies in the production practices, among others.

In this study, existing studies on green finance in the context of the banking sector have been reviewed with considerations on products and determinants of green finance. The content analysis approach has been used to critically analyse and summarize forty-six (46) relevant studies. The results found green securities, green investments, climate finance, carbon finance, green insurance, green credit and green infrastructural bonds as part of key green finance products of banks. Pertinent determinants the study found to be influencing green finance policies from banks include environmental and climate change policies, interest rates, religion, risks, social inclusion and social justice as well as banking regulations. In theory, this study provides a guide for further studies. The results of the study will assist banks on the key issues to consider in adopting, developing and granting green finance. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\"\\n\"Bhandary R.R., Gallagher K.S., Zhang F.\",\"Climate finance policy in practice: a review of the evidence\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099932492&doi=10.1080%2f14693062.2020.1871313&partnerID=40&md5=18c7190bdb89f61b0a29a0230e48224b\",\"This paper empirically evaluates how policy to mobilize climate finance works in practice. It examines the performance of nine types of climate finance policies, namely target lending, green bond policy, loan guarantee programmes, weather indexed insurance, feed-in-tariffs, tax credits, national development banks, disclosure policies and national climate funds, through a literature review and case studies. Both successful and unsuccessful country cases are examined. Criteria are established to evaluate climate finance policy, factors which lead to effective climate finance policy in practice are identified, current knowledge gaps are clarified, and policy implications provided. Key Policy insights The effectiveness of climate finance policies depends on the criteria being used. Strengths and weaknesses exist for each of the climate finance policies. Feed-in tariffs, tax credits, loan guarantees, and national development banks are all effective at mobilizing private finance, but evidence to date is weak or thin on the effectiveness of national climate funds, targeted lending, disclosure, and green bonds. Significant data and research gaps exist regarding the empirical impacts of climate finance policies, especially their environmental and equity impacts. In selecting climate finance policies, a balance should be struck between mobilization effectiveness, economic efficiency, environmental integrity, and equity. \\xc2\\xa9 2021 The Author(s).

This paper examines the optimal interest rate of the bank, and the optimal product green degree and sales price of the manufacturer un-der the two mechanisms, respectively. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of these mechanisms on the optimal decisions, the profits of players, the social welfare and the environmental benefits. Several important results are obtained. First, when the total government subsidy is low, the green credit mechanism can bring the higher green degree, product sales price and demand, as well as higher profits for the bank and manufacturer, rather than the subsidy mecha-nism. Otherwise, the result is opposite. Second, the government should adopt the green credit mechanism to support the manufacturer to develop green prod-ucts when the budget is limited and relatively low. If the government budget is sufficient, the subsidy mechanism is the best choice, which can bring higher economic and environmental benefits. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, Journal of Industrial and Management Optimization.

By matching the Annual Surveys of Industrial Firms dataset with the Ministry of Environmental Protection survey data and the city-level bank competition data, this article explores the effects of banking sector structure on firm-level pollution emissions under the context of bank deregulation. The findings of this study are mainly in four aspects. First, more bank competition can reduce pollution emissions per unit output value. Second, bank competition affects enterprise pollution emissions through alleviating financial constraints. To be more specific, credit availability, credit amount as well as credit cost are the channels for bank competition to affect enterprise pollution emissions. Third, strict environment regulation strengthens the negative effect of bank competition on pollution emissions. Fourth, the mandatory administrative means of impeding banks from lending to polluters did not achieve the aim of pollution reduction.

Imbalances are evident with the increasing levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere. The increased loads of Green House Gas (GHG) emission due to a higher release of carbon content are causing loss of ecosystem services further resulting in climate changes. The forests ecosystems account for ~82% of the continental biomass, a source for higher terrestrial carbon sequestration, playing a vital role in maintaining the carbon cycle and provision of various goods and services, which play a primary role in human\\xe2\\x80\\x99s socioeconomic development. The various initiatives and concerns across the globe are rising to account for the carbon emissions and finding the potential measures for regulation. The carbon dynamics in the Karnataka state has been investigated considering the present status of ecosystems, quantification of sector-wise emissions, and projected likely change in sequestration by modeling land-use changes. Karnataka state now has 15% of the geographical area under forest compared with 21% in 1985. The total above and below ground biomass from forests of Karnataka was 782.1 (Tera Gram) in 1985 and reduced to 519.36 Tg by 2019 due to the largescale land-use changes leading to deforestation and land degradation. The loss of 168 Tg carbon sequestration potential confirms the extent of anthropogenic pressure on the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forest. Carbon sequestered is about 16.1 Tg/year, whereas total emission is around 150.65 Tg. The various sources of carbon emissions were accounted for covering livestock, agriculture to industries for the year 2019 as 150.65Tg, which accounts 5% of India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s total emission. Around 11% of the emission has been captured by the forests of Karnataka. The sequestered carbon accounts to INR 34 billion ($0.5 billion) considering INR 2142 ($30) per tonne for carbon trading, which highlights the scope for higher carbon credits with reforestation of degraded landscapes. \\xc2\\xa9 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\"\\n\"Yeganeh A., McCoy A.P., Reichard G., Schenk T., Hankey S.\",\"Green building and policy innovation in the US Low-Income Housing Tax Credit programme\",2021,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096120081&doi=10.1080%2f09613218.2020.1842165&partnerID=40&md5=dbbe0b5112a4b1c716f51a28c0322bff\",\"This article analyses the integration of green building with the largest low-income housing production programme in the US and the innovativeness of state housing agencies. Drawing on policy innovation literature, panel data and regression analysis are employed to quantify associations between state-level characteristics and the adoption of green building criteria into the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) programme. Results show that housing agencies have increasingly adopted green building criteria, and most have identified co-benefits from energy-efficient buildings and smart growth. Despite overall progress, the rate of adoption of green building criteria has decreased, few US states have comprehensive criteria, and many have dropped important criteria, such as on-site renewable energy generation, often due to perceived additional costs to developers and, in some cases, due to perceived progress in building codes. Results are consistent with hypotheses derived from the literature and suggest that the integration of green building with the LIHTC programme is significantly associated with the states\\xe2\\x80\\x99 internal factors, such as public housing agencies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 motivations and resources, and external factors like regional policy diffusion from other states.

The perceived renovation costs may discourage professionals from pursuing the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating systems. To attain cost-effective LEED certifications, the authors developed an optimization model capable of identifying practical credits then ranking them by their associated costs. A case study was performed using a random sample of nine constructed schools in Dubai. The model output revealed that schools could be renovated to LEED Certified, Silver, Gold, and Platinum with average cost increases of 0.15%, 0.46%, 1.42%, and 4.97%, respectively. Because of the insignificant cost differences between upgrading to LEED Certified, LEED Silver, and LEED Gold, the authors advise upgrading most school buildings to the Gold certificate level. Furthermore, average energy and water consumption savings at the LEED Platinum tier are estimated to be 30% and 27%, respectively. Some sample schools were built to meet the city\\'s mandatory green building regulations, thus allowing the model to identify the effects of local regulation.

Many building factors influence student performance outcomes including cognitive skills, standardized test scores and rates of absenteeism. This review synthesizes current research from 28 new studies and 101 other studies that were previously included in 15 reviews of associations between LEED-specified building factors and these performance outcomes in schools. In appraising the relative quantity and quality of studies, along with the frequency of LEED credits found in certified schools, this review finds that building features common to 100% of LEED-certified schools also have the strongest research supporting associations with academic outcomes, and largely come under the purview of indoor air quality (e.g., minimum ventilation rate, filtration or air cleaning) and acoustic performance. Comparatively, building factors related to the school site and daylighting have fewer associated studies, but findings suggest these are good targets for future research as they may be important for influencing student performance. Achieving a transition to a lower carbon future requires that schools be built with their energy impacts in mind; and this review provides value to those involved in the planning and design of these green schools that facilitate improved student performance outcomes. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\"\\n\"Jaillon L., Poon C.-S., Chan Y.Y., Lee M.W., Cai X.\",\"Green building rating systems and construction waste in high density urban environment: The case study of Hong Kong\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101475710&doi=10.30880%2fijscet.2021.11.04.006&partnerID=40&md5=a48fdf6be06ab720a5563512df07f049\",\"Hong Kong, as many other countries, is currently facing a waste management crisis with the shortage of reclamation sites and landfill space.

To bridge this gap, the current study constructs a green finance development index based on four indicators: green credit, green securities, green insurance, and green investment. A vector error correction model is used to analyze relationships between the development level of green finance, non-fossil energy consumption, and carbon intensity using data from 2000 to 2018. We find that China\\'s green finance industry developed rapidly, and improvements in the green finance development index, as well as the increasing use of non-fossil energy, contributed to a reduction in carbon intensity. Simultaneously, an increase in carbon intensity inhibited the expansion of non-fossil energy use, impeded the investment flow to green projects, and ultimately led to a deterioration of green finance development. In addition, non-fossil energy consumption in China was primarily influenced by green finance and carbon intensity, with clear policy-driven effects. However, the impacts of green finance policies continually fell short and lacked continuity. This study proposes ways in which to improve the effect of green finance policy implementation, expand the consumption of non-fossil energy, and develop a carbon trading market. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Liu X., Wang Y., Pei X., Liang X.\",\"T a development of foreign green credit business and its enlightenment to our country\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098202938&doi=10.1051%2fe3sconf%2f202021801012&partnerID=40&md5=f6a9b663cee000dc923017ab7c232fd1\",\"Green finance is one of the development trends of China\\'s financial industry.

It uses the panel quantile regression method that provides robust results in case the classical econometric assumptions fail. The empirical results revealed that a U-shaped relationship between economic growth and Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions holds in the low, middle and high-emissions countries as opposed to the inverted U-shaped EKC hypothesis. Trade openness reduces environmental performance in low-emission countries. Financial development has mixed impacts on CO2 emissions across the quantiles. While financial development enhances environmental quality in the low-emissions countries, it exerts a detrimental impact in the middle and high-emissions countries. Human capital has significantly positive effects on the lower, middle and upper quantiles. The obtained results highlight the need for raising environmental awareness and promoting green R&amp;D.

Combining an automatic water extraction index, spectral mixture analysis and the normalized difference fraction index (NDFI), we developed water masks and quantified the water-adjusted green vegetation fractions and NDFI values in the forests. Results showed that all forests have been continuously greening up since their establishment, and the average green vegetation cover of all forests increased from approximately 30% in 1988 to above 70% in 2018. With possible contributions from the invasion of exotic understory plant species, we credit community forestry programs for some of the green-up signals. Monitoring of forest vegetation dynamics is critical for evaluating the effectiveness of community forestry as well as developing sustainable forest management policies. Our research will provide positive feedbacks to local community forest committees and users. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 by the authors.

By means of panel data analysis conducted on observations ranging across the period 1970\\xe2\\x80\\x932018, we investigated variables such as domestic credit from banks, domestic credit from the financial sector, GDP, N2O emissions, CO2 emissions and the value added from agriculture, forest and fishing activities. According to our findings, domestic credit from banks was insufficient to achieve green financing. Namely, in order to increase economic growth while reducing global warming and climate change, the financial sector should assume a bigger role in funding green investments. Moreover, our results showed that domestic credit from the financial sector contributed to green financing, while CO2 emissions remained a challenge in capping global warming at the 1.5\\xe2\\x97\\xa6C level. Our empirical study supports the idea that economic growth together with policies targeting climate change and global warming can contribute to green financing.

This is because improvements in energy efficiency can trigger economic growth and considered as one of the \\xe2\\x80\\x98green\\xe2\\x80\\x99 growth strategies due to its carbon free content. To this end, some empirical studies have investigated the nexus between economic growth and energy efficiency, but the effects of the latter on financial indicators have not been sufficiently studied in the literature, at least in developing economies like Africa. This study examines the effect of energy efficiency improvements on commercial bank profitability under different political regimes (i.e., autocratic and democratic political regimes); something previous literature had neglected. The study uses panel data, consisting of 43 African countries and the simultaneous System Generalized Method of Moments. We found that energy efficiency improvement is more likely to induce higher bank profitability in political institutions with the characteristics of centralization of power compared with those with decentralization of power. Furthermore, for the banking sector, the findings suggest that energy utilization behavior of clients should be included in the loan or credit valuation process. For the government, the agenda of energy efficiency should be aggressively pursued while taking cognizance of creating a political environment that weans itself from a \\xe2\\x80\\x98grandfathering\\xe2\\x80\\x99 behavior. \\xc2\\xa9 2020, The Author(s).\"\\n\"Wang Y., Lei X., Long R., Zhao J.\",\"Green Credit, Financial Constraint, and Capital Investment: Evidence from China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Energy-intensive Enterprises\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089404222&doi=10.1007%2fs00267-020-01346-w&partnerID=40&md5=ee67faa84375ca4ee524d4c0c28b7d3f\",\"The green credit policy is an important green financial tool that can achieve the win\\xe2\\x80\\x93win scenario with economic development and environmental protection through the reasonable allocation of credit resources.

The empirical results showed that the capital investment of energy-intensive enterprises was significantly reduced after the promulgation of the GCGs. Considering the intermediary paths along with the green credit policy on energy-intensive investment through financial constraints, the total bank loans and long-term bank loans played partial intermediary roles, whereas the short-term bank loans as mediator variable showed no significant intermediary effect. The findings of this study illustrated that the green credit policy has been well implemented and promoted in China.

Although the renewable energy consumption is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it may not promote green economic development due to the constraints of existing technical conditions. Therefore, the technological advancement approach that can help coordinate the relationship between renewable energy consumption and green economic development should be identified. That is, determining whether to develop new technologies or improve existing technologies should be paid more attention in the context of continuous increase in renewable energy consumption. Results: (1) The inverted N-shaped relationship between renewable energy consumption and green economic development under the existing technical conditions. The degree of renewable energy consumption can merely promote green economic development in the interval of 0.67\\xe2\\x80\\x9310.87. That is, the renewable energy consumption (% of total energy consumption) is less than 0.67% or greater than 10.87%, which is not conducive to green economic development. (2) Developing new technologies can stimulate the positive effect of renewable energy consumption on green economic development. However, the improvement of existing technologies fails to exhibit an effective impact on the relationship between renewable energy consumption and green economic development. (3) Coordinating the relationship between renewable energy consumption and green economic development can also be achieved by reducing the dependence of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on fossil fuels. (4) The stage of economic development might impact the effect of renewable energy on green economic development. Conclusions: It is particularly important to improve technological innovation capabilities, especially in countries with a high proportion of renewable energy consumption. In addition, the government should guide the funds and resources to the renewable energy industry through the credit rationing system to promote the transition of the industrial structure to an environmentally friendly direction. For countries with relatively low levels of economic development, this does not mean that these countries should reduce their demand for renewable energy. Instead, these countries need to take more proactive measures, such as increasing technological innovation capabilities and optimizing industrial structure to coordinate the relationship between renewable energy consumption and green economic development. \\xc2\\xa9 2020, The Author(s).\"\\n\"Vu H.P., Nguyen L.N., Vu M.T., Johir M.A.H., McLaughlan R., Nghiem L.D.\",\"A comprehensive review on the framework to valorise lignocellulosic biomass as biorefinery feedstocks\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087873405&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2020.140630&partnerID=40&md5=559f765d1fe6f2da1cec2b2685e3c255\",\"An effective pretreatment is the first step to enhance the digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a source of renewable, eco-friendly and energy-dense materials \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for biofuel and biochemical productions. This review aims to provide a comprehensive assessment on the advantages and disadvantages of lignocellulosic pretreatment techniques, which have been studied at the lab-, pilot- and full-scale levels. Biological pretreatment is environmentally friendly but time consuming (i.e. 15\\xe2\\x80\\x9340 days). Chemical pretreatment is effective in breaking down lignocellulose and increasing sugar yield (e.g. 4 to 10-fold improvement) but entails chemical cost and expensive reactors. Whereas the combination of physical and chemical (i.e. physicochemical) pretreatment is energy intensive (e.g. energy production can only compensate 80% of the input energy) despite offering good process efficiency (i.e. > 100% increase in product yield). Demonstrations of pretreatment techniques (e.g. acid, alkaline, and hydrothermal) in pilot-scale have reported 50\\xe2\\x80\\x9380% hemicellulose solubilisation and enhanced sugar yields. The feasibility of these pilot and full-scale plants has been supported by government subsidies to encourage biofuel consumption (e.g. tax credits and mandates). Due to the variability in their mechanisms and characteristics, no superior pretreatment has been identified. The main challenge lies in the capability to achieve a positive energy balance and great economic viability with minimal environmental impacts i.e. the energy or product output significantly surpasses the energy and monetary input. Enhancement of the current pretreatment techno-economic efficiency (e.g. higher product yield, chemical recycling, and by-products conversion to increase environmental sustainability) and the integration of pretreatment methods to effectively treat a range of biomass will be the steppingstone for commercial lignocellulosic biorefineries. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 Elsevier B.V.\"\\n\"Solla M., Milad A., Hakim L., Shaarani A., Yusoff N.I.M., Abass F.\",\"The Application of Building Information Modelling in Green Building Index for Energy Efficiency Assessment\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100735135&doi=10.1109%2fIEEECONF51154.2020.9320002&partnerID=40&md5=ad94708bf8ad3b14080116fbd9629bef\",\"Energy efficiency (EE) is one of the criteria in the Green Building Index (GBI), and the assessment of EE might be by Building Information Modelling (BIM) feature. BIM is the most powerful tool that can help to assist and digitals each credit of EE criteria in the GBI assessment.

Data-level, algorithm-level and ensemble solutions are the three main methods proposed thus far to address imbalance learning. To alleviate the issues of data explosion and feature selection for a multilayer perceptron with simultaneous two-sample representation, in this paper, we propose a novel feature selection method based on the pairwise samples distance constraint, which considers the class labels of paired samples, select the features which push two similar samples closer together and pull two different samples farther apart.

To achieve its goal, RPCC uses the decentralized adaptive manner to dynamically create and place replicas.

First, the building was assessed with respect to achievable credits with its current state through a three-dimensional (3D) model. Students were encouraged to consider which sustainable practices would be applicable if the building was originally designed and built as a GB. Then, the building was reassessed with the intention for additional applicable credits and corresponding points. The construction phase was also reviewed for extra credit points that could be earned from construction activities to contribute to LEED certification. The main objective is to introduce students to two major trends in the construction industry, namely GB and BIM applications, and create awareness of sustainable construction, GB certification systems, and emerging technologies. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.\"\\n\"Malinowski P.A., Schwarz P.M., Wu J.S.\",\"Fee Credits as an Economic Incentive for Green Infrastructure Retrofits in Stormwater-Impaired Urban Watersheds\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087641910&doi=10.1061%2fJSWBAY.0000923&partnerID=40&md5=11031906f13d8b7c20fd13e3eaf9e7c9\",\"Low participation rates in existing US stormwater utility fee credit programs indicate that the benefits attributed to credits are not being realized, most notably, the financial incentive for private property owners to control stormwater on their sites. This is problematic if credits are to be used to achieve the level of private property participation in green infrastructure (GI) retrofits necessary to effect stream quality improvements in stormwater-impaired urban watersheds. This paper examines economic and policy issues related to the use of stormwater fee credits as a market-based incentive strategy for private commercial property owners to invest in GI retrofits. The City of Charlotte, North Carolina, stormwater user fee and credit program is assessed relative to the direct use and investment value of GI retrofits, and an economically efficient configuration is defined that will provide both the stormwater utility and private commercial property owners with adequate incentive for investment. The results indicate that a stormwater fee and credit combination for a stormwater utility based on the cost of capital and credits for GI retrofits, and credits to property owners equal to the cost of annual maintenance for GI retrofits, can provide adequate incentive for investment by both groups. The fee magnitude and credit structures of several other existing US municipal stormwater programs were evaluated relative to these results. This research can be used to address policy questions regarding the role of stormwater utility fee and credit programs in promoting sustainable urban water infrastructure goals in stormwater-impaired watersheds and in making beneficial connections between the seemingly disparate goals of water quantity and water quality management policies. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.\"\\n\"Sinha S.\",\"Betting on Potatoes: Accumulation in Times of Agrarian Crisis in Punjab, India\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085057245&doi=10.1111%2fdech.12589&partnerID=40&md5=d9cf81773597b30ea15f05a897325714\",\"Despite the widespread consensus that neoliberal India is reeling under an overarching agrarian crisis, this article argues that at least some capitalist farmers are continuing to accumulate and are thereby contributing to the process of class differentiation.

However, policies are based on attributional life cycle assessments (LCAs) that do not account for market constraints and consider byproducts either available burden-free to the user (cutoff approach) or partially responsible for the emissions generated in the upstream processes (allocation). The goal of this study was to investigate whether these approaches (and incentives) could lead to a mismanagement of byproducts and to suboptimal solutions in terms of regional GHG emissions. The use of ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) in Ontario was studied, and an optimization model to find the least GHG-intense way of using GGBS was developed. Results showed that producers should replace 30 to 40% of portland cement in high-strength concrete to minimize the regional GHG emissions associated with concrete. However, traditional LCA approaches do not suggest this solution and are estimated to lead to up to a 10% increase in concrete GHG emissions in Ontario. The substitution method, which assigns emissions or credits to byproducts based on emissions associated with the products they may displace, can yield decisions consistent with the regional emission optimization model.

However, the applicability of considering water as part of energy or the fact that the utilization of energy mandates the usage of water seems unexplored and is not yet included in any of the existing building rating systems. A unified approach of water and energy resources is thus vital for future considerations in energy policy, planning, and the inclusion of the same in the sustainability rating systems. This paper investigated, as a case study, the prospects of water-energy nexus in the prevailing UAE green building rating system-PRS-to uncover whether any water conservation strategy has an adverse effect on energy and vice versa. The review revealed that the major shortcomings of the PRS in terms of water-energy nexus strategy are the usage of reference codes that are not suitable for the UAE\\'s climate and geographical conditions, inexistent synergy between some credit categories, the oversight of rebound effects, and a need for credit reassessment. The paper also recommends that any proposed strategy to realign credit categories in terms of the water-energy nexus with the potential risk to also have a hidden negative rebound effect that researchers and practitioners should identify lest the water-energy tradeoff brings unprecedented repercussions. The theoretical analysis establishes that the bifurcating management of water and energy in the sustainability rating system and energy policy needs to be revisited in order to reap more sustainable and optimum results that are environmentally, ecologically, and financially consistent. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 by the authors.\"\\n\"Benns M., Ruther M., Nash N., Bozeman M., Harbrecht B., Miller K.\",\"The impact of historical racism on modern gun violence: Redlining in the city of Louisville, KY\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087661549&doi=10.1016%2fj.injury.2020.06.042&partnerID=40&md5=3d7089b935acb91496fd4037990673de\",\"Background: The Home Owner\\'s Loan Corporation (HOLC) was created in 1933 to provide government backing of troubled mortgages during the Great Depression. Residential security maps were created to guide investment in over 200 US cities. Neighborhoods were assigned grades of \\xe2\\x80\\x98A\\xe2\\x80\\x99 through \\xe2\\x80\\x98D\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (with corresponding color coding of green, blue, yellow and red) to indicate desirability for investment. Neighborhoods with a high percentage of African Americans or other minorities were frequently assigned grades of \\xe2\\x80\\x98C\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or \\xe2\\x80\\x98D\\xe2\\x80\\x99. These maps are now most associated with redlining, or the process of denial of credit for real estate investment based on race. Resulting economic disparities endure in areas of many US cities today. We hypothesized that there would be a correlation between redlined areas on the 1937 map of Louisville, KY to the prevalence of gun violence today. Methods: Gunshot victims (GSV) and their residential addresses within the city of Louisville were examined between 2012 and 2018. GSVs were aggregated within census block groups to approximate neighborhoods. The spatial distribution of GSVs was analyzed against the original HOLC neighborhood grade. Additional control variables adapted from the 2013\\xe2\\x80\\x932017 American Community Survey were included to account for other possible explanations for the spatial distribution of GSVs. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression with a spatial component was used to determine incidence rate ratios (IRR) for the relative likelihood of GSVs within neighborhoods. Results: Relative to green-graded neighborhoods, red-graded neighborhoods had five times as many GSVs. This difference remained statistically significant after accounting for differences in demographic, racial, and housing characteristics of the neighborhoods. Conclusion: Redlined neighborhoods within Louisville, KY in 1937 had significantly more GSVs today. The impact of historical and institutional racism on modern gun violence merits acknowledgement and further study. \\xc2\\xa9 2020\"\\n\"Li Z., Tang Y., Wu J., Zhang J., Lv Q.\",\"The Interest Costs of Green Bonds: Credit Ratings, Corporate Social Responsibility, and Certification\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060491375&doi=10.1080%2f1540496X.2018.1548350&partnerID=40&md5=ac35d79c351afbf41d80579f0a3d460d\",\"In recent years, green financing has attracted global attention. Many countries and international organizations have proposed frameworks for developing green financing, and an increasing number of companies issue green bonds as financial instruments for funding green projects. Unlike conventional bonds, green bonds have unique features, and their issuance follows a special process. We use data on Chinese green bonds in a linear regression model to empirically explore the impact of credit ratings, corporate social responsibility\\xc2\\xa0(CSR), and green certification on yield spreads. The results show that these factors all have a significant impact on interest costs. Issuing green bonds is a signal of CSR, and green bonds with green certificates have lower interest costs than those without them. Finally, we outline some policy implications regarding the governance of green bonds based on our findings. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\"\\n\"Woo J., Kibert C.J., Newman R., Kachi A.S.K., Fatima R., Tian Y.\",\"A New Blockchain Digital MRV (Measurement, Reporting, and Verification) Architecture for Existing Building Energy Performance\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095585701&doi=10.1109%2fBRAINS49436.2020.9223302&partnerID=40&md5=58cdae1731b15ca5d87d5b15099fc9ba\",\"The widespread and massive effects of climate are now inevitable, and action must be taken by all sectors to mitigate their contributions to its impacts. The building sector accounts for about 40% of global energy consumption and 30% of GHG emissions. This sector must reduce its energy consumption by at least 50% by shifting to hyper-efficient systems and renewable energy to meet the climate change mitigation goal. Certified green buildings are responsible for about 40% of the office markets in the U. S. and utilize the types of strategies that should be implemented by all new construction and major renovations. Certified green buildings, although highly effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, are generally considered to be an expensive solution to this problem. There is excellent potential for the construction sector to employ a blockchain framework of measurement, report, and verification (MRV) towards building energy performance (BEP) to enable certified green buildings to earn carbon credits based on their exceptional energy performance. Blockchain technology eliminates the need for intermediaries to validate the data and builds up a reliable, immutable, traceable energy monitoring system. The goal of this paper is to present a new blockchain digital MRV architecture for existing BEP and a prototype of its application. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 IEEE.\"\\n\"He C., Yan G.\",\"Path selections for sustainable development of green finance in developed coastal areas of China\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092541042&doi=10.2112%2fJCR-SI104-014.1&partnerID=40&md5=549efea6686887aae701b2634dd47bb9\",\"The study of green finance is not only of great theoretical significance, but also of great policy value.

As such, multinational companies promote their efforts into the energy transition by unveiling their objectives and attainment of voluntary renewable energy 100% (RE 100). The establishment of their goals for RE 100 is likely to obligate their business partners to encourage wider use of renewables while the corporate sourcing conditions for renewables and institutional strategies in Korea are still nascent. Accordingly, the arrangement of both effective measures to facilitate corporate renewable energy procurement and reasonable standards to validate the renewable electricity consumption is now required to keep domestic industries immensely competitive, simply not to fulfill the national target of green gas emissions. Though multiple procurement pathways vary across countries based on how they are implemented and detailed market rules and regulations, utility green tariffs, which have emerged recently in U.S. markets, are highly regarded as economical and stable options to meet renewable energy demand from corporations. Typically, in utility green tariffs, the utility procures renewable energy on behalf of the electricity customers, and they pay a special utility green tariff rate for the renewable energy service. Compared with other potential opportunities, utility green tariffs have an overwhelming advantage of reduced financial burdens on renewable energy purchases by realizing the renewable energy offerings with overall cost savings through enabling renewable generators to seek assurances that their investments in renewables should be returned on a long-term basis. Finally, this paper purports to come up with a viable and vibrant green tariff mechanism in Korean electric power transaction frameworks and, at the same time, the overarching insights into various requirements considered to trigger this scheme in an amicable manner.

To obtain the solution with faster execution time, a quantum-inspired genetic algorithm with in vitro fertilization (IVF) crossover and mutation operator is developed. Our results illustrate the non-linear change in the number of markets selection, routing and procurement planning with changes in product availability and substitutes. We show that the designing of suitable carbon credit/penalty structure is essential to obtain a green network with minor compromises in travel and transportation costs. The flexibility of multiple vehicle types reduces both cost and emission significantly. As a part of the methodological contribution, the superiority of our heuristic is established by testing on benchmark TPP instances using a rigorous statistical test. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Susan S., Wardhani D.\",\"Building integrated photovoltaic as GREENSHIP\\'S on site renewable energy tool\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088248750&doi=10.1016%2fj.rineng.2020.100153&partnerID=40&md5=7b5fcce635d8b17e1f6120469dd51443\",\"Building challenges energy production from various sources, since it consumes energy in each stage of its life. The electrical energy in Indonesia is mostly produced by fossil fuel, an unrenewable energy resources has led to negative impacts on the environment. Thus, the availability of this resource is getting less. Fortunately, Indonesia has abundant renewable energy resources, and the use of these resources are still a minimum. This fact is supported by the data that many of Green-certificated buildings in Indonesia failed to take credit for the on-site renewable energy in their assessment. This research presents the proposed case of Universitas Ciputra. A building which was designed with green features and has the potential for on-site renewable energy integration, particularly for solar energy with BIPV as its concept. The aim of this research is to observe efforts made for optimizing electrical energy production from the renewable energy resources, along with the amount of optimum electrical energy generated compared to Greenship standards.

Here we apply an interdisciplinary approach to develop spatially explicit projections of LULC at a resolution of 30 \\xc3\\x97 30 m informed by historic relationships between LULC and their key drivers, within the context of the four qualitative scenarios of global shared socioeconomic pathways. We apply this methodology to a case study in the Zona da Mata, Brazil, which has a history of major LULC changes. The analysis of LULC changes from 1986 to 2015 indicates that pasture area decreased from 76 to 58 % of total area, while forest areas increased from 18 to 24 %, and coffee from 3 to 11 %. Environmental protection legislation, rural credit for smallholder farmers, and demand for agricultural and raw products were identified as main drivers of LULC changes. Projected LULC for 2045 strongly depends on the global socioeconomic pathway scenarios, and forest and coffee areas may increase substantially under strong government measures in the environmentally conscious Green Road scenario or decrease in the high consumption Rocky Road scenario. Our study shows that under the set of drivers during the past three decades reforestation can go hand in hand with increase of agricultural production, but that major and contrasting changes in LULC can be expected depending on the socioeconomic pathway that will be followed in the future. To guide this process, LULC scenarios at the local scale can inform the planning of local and regional development and forest conservation. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Nazir M.S., Bilal M., Sohail H.M., Liu B., Chen W., Iqbal H.M.N.\",\"Impacts of renewable energy atlas: Reaping the benefits of renewables and biodiversity threats\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087217120&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijhydene.2020.05.195&partnerID=40&md5=0464a3ae62a53a19c4c3630d4d0390ee\",\"In recent years, owing to the long-span adverse impact of utilizing petrochemicals and economic crises, wind energy has stood-up as a cost-effective source of energy.

As a consequence of this, the government has been constantly reinforcing the eco-civilization construction along with the enhancement of supervision in environmental pollution activities, which makes enterprises lay more emphasis on environmental information disclosure. Meanwhile, Chinese government has prompted the Green Credit Policy, which closely linked environmental protection with corporate finance and bank credit, making corporate environmental performance a crucial basis to obtain financing. According to this, whether the disclosure of environmental information will influence the debt finance of a corporate deserves further studying. Through the angle of Green Credit Policy, this paper uses the 2013-2018 data from Chinese listed companies of heavy polluted industries in A stock market as samples, conducting empirical research on the relationship between environmental disclosure and the cost of debt.

We found that the firm\\'s technology capacity of improving the energy-saving level of FV plays an important role in affecting the firm\\'s selections of GTIs. Specifically, when the technology capacity is moderate, the firm chooses both types of GTIs to produce both EV and energy-saving FV, otherwise he will choose one type only. Moreover, no matter which GTI is selected by the firm, its pricing and environmental efforts decisions keep the same. With the dual-credit policy, we found that it could encourage the production of the EV under certain conditions. Besides this, increasing the green credit of EV can align the economic and environmental interests while increasing standard energy consumption has conflicts in both interests. In particular, when the firm offers FV only or both EV and FV, increasing the price of credit has conflicting interests in economy and environment. However, when the firm offers EV only, increasing the price of credit could improve the firm\\'s profit without hurting the environment. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 by the authors.\"\\n\"Alonso-Conde A.-B., Rojo-Su\\xc3\\xa1rez J.\",\"On the effect of green bonds on the profitability and credit quality of project financing\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089797473&doi=10.3390%2fsu12166695&partnerID=40&md5=8a122d72ccd02c489146ea9586868984\",\"The relatively recent green bond market is increasingly attracting interest at the technical, regulatory, and academic research levels.

In order to measure the impact of green bond financing on the profitability and solvency of environmentally friendly investments, we study the sensitivity of the financial performance of a well-established project finance investment-the Sagunto regasification plant-to shifts in its financial structure. In particular, we develop a base case that allows us to study the impact of green financing compared to other financial structures typically used in project finance, under different scenarios.

This approach not only helps enrich the research on digital finance and clarify the differences between digital financial services and traditional financial services but also provides theoretical support for making full use of the development opportunity of digital finance to promote farmers to adopt green control techniques and ultimately achieve sustainable agricultural development. \\xc2\\xa9 2020\"\\n\"Li F., Feng S., Lu H., Qu F., D\\'Haese M.\",\"The role of contract type in soil-improving investments: Evidence from rice-planting large-scale production units in China\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082682739&doi=10.1017%2fS1355770X20000091&partnerID=40&md5=e23dda48cf10cd370e763557df2e2e88\",\"The emerging large-scale production units (LSPUs) have become increasingly important in Chinese agricultural production and rural transformation due to rapid industrialization and urbanization. Based on household and plot-level data from Jiangsu and Jiangxi Provinces in China, this study provides insights into the farming systems of these LSPUs and examines how contract type, as a proxy for land tenure security, impacts on the production unit\\'s soil-improving investments. Results from the two-stage control function approach show that the written nature of contracts positively affects the application of organic fertilizer and green manure on rented-in plots. Descriptive analysis also confirms the collateralization effect of contract type by showing that plots that are used as collateral for credit are characterized by written contracts. Policies facilitating LSPUs\\' access to farmland with more formal contracts may therefore play an important role in improving soil quality and land productivity.

However, there is uncertainty whether this increased demand can be met by the conventional approaches of capture fisheries and fish farming because of wild stock depletion, natural resource requirements, and environmental impact concerns. One proposed complementary solution is to manufacture the same meat directly from fish cells, as cell-based fish. More than 30 ventures are competing to commercialize cell-based meat broadly, but the field lacks a foundation of shared scientific knowledge, which threatens to delay progress. Here, we recommend taking a research-focused, more open and collaborative approach to cell-based fish meat development that targets lean fish and an unlikely but very attractive candidate for accelerating research and development, the zebrafish. Although substantial work lies ahead, cell-based meat technology could prove to be a more efficient, less resource-intensive method of producing lean fish meat. Sustainably meeting the growing demand for fish protein is a key challenge. In this Perspective, we demonstrate that advancing cell-based fish technology is an urgent priority. We show that lean fish is likely a more straightforward cell-based fish meat to produce and that zebrafish is best positioned for initial research efforts. We conclude that a more open, collaborative approach, with an eye toward simplicity, is necessary to co-create knowledge and successfully advance the field of cell-based fish.

Based on this, taking 92 renewable energy listed enterprises in China from 2007 to 2016 as sample, it investigates the effect of green institutional environment on renewable energy investment with semiparametric method and further discusses how the effect works. The results show that, first, there is a nonlinear (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cU-shaped\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) relationship between green institutional environment index and renewable energy investment. It indicates that when green institutional environment is in the initial stage of development, it cannot promote renewable energy investment, but produces an inhibitory effect; however, when the green institutional environment develops to a certain level, it will significantly promote renewable energy investment. Second, green institutional environmental index consists of green credit, government subsidies and environmental taxes. When the green credit and government subsidies develop to certain levels, they will promote renewable energy investment, however, when government subsidies exceed a certain level, it may produce a negative impact on renewable energy investment, and effect of the green institutional environment on renewable energy investment is mainly reflected through green credit; besides, increasing environmental taxes can promote renewable energy investment in sample intervals. Third, the impact of green institutional environment on renewable energy investment of large enterprises is more significant than that of medium-, small-, and micro-sized enterprises; however, the impact of government subsidies on renewable energy investment is mainly embodied in medium-, small-, and micro-sized enterprises. Fourth, during a period of high volatility (2012\\xe2\\x80\\x932015), relationship between the green institutional environment and renewable energy investment (inverted \\xe2\\x80\\x9cU-shaped\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) are different from that of 2007\\xe2\\x80\\x932016. It indicates that the implementation of policies has increased the volatility of the level of the green institutional environment, which may lead to a negative impact on renewable energy investment. \\xc2\\xa9 2020\"\\n\"Papapostolou A., Mexis F.D., Sarmas E., Karakosta C., Psarras J.\",\"Web-based Application for Screening Energy Efficiency Investments: A MCDA Approach\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099261386&doi=10.1109%2fIISA50023.2020.9284403&partnerID=40&md5=ae0cea6b0387dd207d71611a24f6e93c\",\"Energy Efficiency (EE) has been identified as one of the most cost-effective means aiming at reducing energy consumption while maintaining an equivalent level of economic activity. Mainstreaming EE financing is considered a key priority to avert climate change. The lack of evidence on the performance, commonly agreed procedures and standards for EE investments, particularly during the first stages of investment generation and pre-selection/pre-evaluation, are the key problems hampering EE investment financing. It is also true that often project developers do not have the expertise or resources to make a convincing financing case for investors. In order to boost EE investments, this paper proposes a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methodology intending to support financing institutions to identify attractive EE project ideas in the early development phase of project initiation and planning. The study implements the ELECTRE TRI method to benchmark EE project ideas in a standardized, investor recognizable credit rating form. A respective web-based tool facilitating the methodology and the screening of EE projects is also developed, supporting financing bodies and EE funds to rapidly detect and aggregate projects that meet the necessary criteria to be financed. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 IEEE.\"\\n\"Wei Y., Hao K.\",\"On Building a Green Credit System for Marine Environment Protection\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091770653&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f525%2f1%2f012072&partnerID=40&md5=8e12af2677dd5f89f7577cd068af1a93\",\"On August 31, 2016, the People\\'s Bank of China (PBC), along with six other government agencies, issued the Guidelines for Establishing the Green Financial System, introducing a series of measures to support and encourage green investment and financing.

The political crisis is connected to other less prominent crises in the country: youth unemployment, the quality of tea (Mali\\xe2\\x80\\x99s national drink) and the decline of Malian social values. Some of the green tea traders profited from these crises while others experienced reduced sales volumes and still others faced severe losses. Elderly persons began accusing green tea to contribute to the social problems. Tea was as an imported product, prevented the young from looking for work and encouraged corruption and fraud. The tea merchants in turn tried to keep prices stable, emphasized that their activity was hard work that required experience, knowledge and enabled many smaller traders to make a living. They also took on some of the responsibilities of the state by distributing trade goods for free to accumulate social credit.

This study explored the dynamic relationship between business growth and carbon emission performance by constructing and using a time series model to predict the trend of carbon emission. The time series method (ADF unit root test, cointegration test and VAR model etc.) was adopted to investigate 805 companies listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange from 2012 to 2017 as the sample of this study. The carbon emission performance variables include: total carbon emission, annual increase of carbon emission, and annual increase rate of carbon emission. The business growth variables include: growth rate, stability of growth, and years of establishment. The results showed a long-term dynamic relationship between business growth and carbon emission performance. Therefore, using the time series method can assist enterprises in developing green strategies, strengthen carbon emission prediction and management capacities, reduce operating costs and risks, and actively achieve the ideal of sustainable development. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 by the authors.\"\\n\"Brown S., Pannu M., Fransen S.C.\",\"Greener gas?

In order to better understand the role of water resources in terrestrial ecosystems, the concepts of blue water and green water have been introduced. However, the traditional water resources assessment often focuses on the amount of blue water resources (surface runoff, soil runoff and underground runoff), and the green water (evapotranspiration water and soil water) which is important for the maintenance of terrestrial ecosystems is often neglected. The ecological process of the basin is organically coupled with the water cycle process of the basin through the link of blue and green water, which makes the water cycle and ecological process closely linked, and also reflects the relationship between vegetation and hydrological process. Therefore, this article is based on SWAT model, from the perspective of different land use types and the hydrologic cycle, simulation of large scale he river the blue water, green water resources in 1981-2014, explore he blue green water in time and space distribution characteristics of Min-Tuo river basin, the Man-Kendall (M-K) annual inspection analysis between water resources quantity change trend, simulation of blue green water resources under different land use scenarios. The results showed that :(1)from 1981 to 2014, the amount of green water resources in the Min-Tuo river basin increased, and the M-K statistical value was 0.0232, failing the significance test of M-K confidence degree of 90%. The blue water resources and precipitation in the basin showed a decreasing trend, and the M-K statistical values were -0.1729 and -0.1087, respectively, which failed to pass the significance test of M-K confidence degree of 90%, and the linear variation trend was not significant. (2) The spatial distribution trend of annual precipitation and blue and green water resources in the Min-Tuo river basin from 1981 to 2014 was basically the same. The amount of blue and green water resources in the basin gradually increased from north to south and then decreased, that is, the amount in the middle reaches was the most, followed by the amount in the downstream, and the amount in the upstream was the least. (3) The whole Min-Tuo river basin under the condition of rainfall, forest land, grass blue water resource fluctuations decrease, green water resources increase slowly, and in different land use types, blue, green water resource differences apparent, characterized by cultivated land > forest land > grassland, including arable land accounts for only 25% of total area of the basin, but the blue and green water resource of the contribution of the highest. It is proposed to strengthen the management of cultivated land in the Min-Tuo river basin, rationallutilize the blue and green water resources in the middle and lower reaches, and implement green water credit compensation measures in the arid and semi-arid areas in the upper reaches, so as to optimize the allocation of regional water resources. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Agrometeorology.

Are higher incomes, lower mortgage rates and green income-tax credits impacting housing price changes? Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses the least-squares regression model with natural log specifications. The log of income and a dummy variable, which was assigned to the Energy Policy Act (2005) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009) coverage dates are used as independent variables. Two regression models were examined using monthly housing price data from January 1990 through the year 2018. The first regression model used a single dummy variable for credits available under the Policy Act of 2005 and the Recovery Act of 2009. The second regression model considered the credits granted under these two laws separately. Disposable income per capita impacts demands for housing while green upgrade expenditures affect the cost of housing. Findings: The laws set low credit limits of $500 followed by $1,500 but because of the multiplier effect, the spending appears to have magnified and been much higher. The credit availability variables have positive coefficients and were significant at 1 per cent. This implies that single-family housing prices were sensitive to the existence of residential energy property income-tax credits. The R2 results were 0.93 or above for both models. Research limitations/implications: The data used was aggregated and publicly available online. Many studies use aggregated macroeconomic data when modeling housing prices using the exogenous variable of disposable income but there is no substitute for examining individual homes by location and their sales price to see under what conditions green income-tax credits have the most impact. There could be demographic issues that are missed when using aggregated information. Practical implications: Spending on heating/cooling systems, dual pane windows and other green amenities keeps the housing stock modernized and housing prices steady or rising. An additional benefit is that spending motivated by self-interest can simulate household consumption spending. Houses deteriorate due to wear and tear. Physical-repairable depreciation represents a situation where maintenance funds are continuously needing to be spent. Repairs and upgrades to the structure of the property keep its price stable by stopping the physical depreciation that would otherwise occur with the passage of time. Social implications: The paper provides support for the idea that residential green amenity upgrades positively impact the value of a house. These green-amenity upgrades, which other research studies have suggested should be included explicitly in the appraisal process, are a major characteristic of a property when a price estimate is being done. Housing being sold should have a section on the information sheet noting the property green upgrades that exist and an energy efficiency score should be assigned to each house listed for sale. Originality/value: There are few (if any) academic research papers studying the impact of green tax credits available under the Energy Policy Act (2005) and under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009). The degree to which green income-tax credits stimulate spending on housing has not been addressed by researchers. This paper is an initial research attempt to quantify whether these legislative efforts measurably encouraged homeowners to adopt newer, greener technologies. \\xc2\\xa9 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.\"\\n\"Song X., Wang Q., Cheong K.W., Cheong K.C.\",\"Astride tradition and modernity: Rizhao as China\\'s urban future?\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091114551&doi=10.22452%2fMJES.vol57no1.8&partnerID=40&md5=6919301b6bf1fcc1e67e067709eec330\",\"Located in an area of great antiquity, Rizhao, a prefectural city of 3 million in China\\'s Shandong province, is both a victim and beneficiary of its long history.

ICM is viewed as a three concentric layer system: technological, industrial integration, and decision-making. The search for viable ICM solutions in a given societal and economic context, which could be posed as an inverse design problem, begins with the identification and characterization of every system component. As an early writing on the development and applicability of the proposed ICM framework, this contribution focuses on ICM\\'s inner technological layer. Several technological pathways, each one defined as a set of processing and transformation steps that connect a feedstock to a specific marketable product, can coexist within this layer. The paper addresses the characterization of one such technological pathway, whose cycle is divided into three successive blocks: feedstock, carbonation and valorization. The proposed concepts are illustrated through the valorization of ferronickel slag from New Caledonia as supplementary cementitious material or cement constituent, a case study that targets the production of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreener\\xe2\\x80\\x9d construction materials. The data presented in the paper confirm the feasibility of characterizing the chosen ICM technological pathway, giving credit to the proposition that ICM can be approached as an inverse design problem. While exemplifying the significance of the characterization work necessary for one particular ICM technological pathway, the paper argues that development of ICM requires working on a scale considerably larger than that of standard mineral carbonation process research. Indeed, where grams of carbonated products are sufficient to investigate mineral carbonation processes, kilograms are mandatory to test and validate the use performance of final marketable products. Without precluding the merits of seeking innovative solutions, the authors argue that unit operations and transformation processes whose validity is proven at an industrial scale should be favored for timely development of viable ICM solutions. \\xc2\\xa9 Copyright \\xc2\\xa9 2020 Bourgeois, Laniesse, Cyr and Julcour.\"\\n[No author name available],\"Erratum: Integrative approach using Yersinia pestis genomes to revisit the historical landscape of plague during the Medieval Period (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (2018) 115 (E11790-E11797) DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1812865115)\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085904973&doi=10.1073%2fpnas.2007983117&partnerID=40&md5=4bf0de614149077fe6f1f37d9f11373e\",\"Correction for \"\"Integrative approach using Yersinia pestis genomes to revisit the historical landscape of plague during the Medieval Period,\"\" by Amine Namouchi, Meriam Guellil, Oliver Kersten, Stephanie H\\xc3\\xa4nsch, Claudio Ottoni, Boris V.

There is also more concern in many companies about reducing energy consumption in manufacturing. Improving environmental health and safety, production cost saving, access to governmental incentives such as grants and tax credits and also improving the brand image are the most important reasons which is leading many companies to an environmental-friendly production planning. For example, one of the most applicable scheduling problems deals with planning jobs on numbers of parallel machines. In such an application, different machines have different technologies and different speed and power of energy consumption in manufacturing similar jobs. This article introduced a mathematical formulation which models the green parallel machines scheduling problem with total energy consumption and total completion time as objectives. Due to high computational complexity of the proposed model, a heuristic algorithm is developed to obtain the exact Pareto frontier of these two objectives with a polynomial complexity. Numerical experiments are presented to show the efficiency and speed of the proposed algorithm compared to solving the model using the optimisation software directly. \\xc2\\xa9 2019, \\xc2\\xa9 2019 Operational Research Society.\"\\n\"Colombage S., Nanayakkara K.G.M.\",\"Impact of credit quality on credit spread of green bonds: A global evidence\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096778633&partnerID=40&md5=c4f5d53e84763268f51ac3bf3515ab1c\",\"This study investigates the effect of credit quality on the credit spread of green bonds (GB).

This requirement has traditionally been fulfilled through several existing techniques. However, recent interests in greening the utility grids require using more renewable energy sources, which makes the balancing task more challenging due to the unpredictability of such sources. This necessitates enhancing the grid\\'s flexibility (energy balancing capabilities) to ensure reliable grid operation. In this work, we propose a new energy auctioning mechanism that enhances the grid\\'s upward flexibility by using cloud datacenters as managed loads to quickly balance excess renewable energy. The auction process increases the energy consumption at a certain datacenter by incentivizing workload migrations to it in order to consume the excess energy.

The empirical results indicated that GCG had a negative impact, not only on research and development (R&D) input, but also on innovation output, and the impacts on firms with different property rights and different scales were consistent. Further research showed that GCG reduced the long-term debt of firms in pollution-intensive industries, and then significantly decreased the R&D input and innovation output; that is, long-term debt is a mediator in GCG and technology innovation.

It first considers financial sector development and finds that a better functioning of financial system raises and then reduces CO2 emissions with financial deepening. We then investigate whether financial structure, i.e., the dominance of stock markets over banks, matters and find that a more market-led (bank-led) financial system alleviates (enhances) but eventually aggravates (lowers) CO2 emissions. We also check for market power in banking and show that CO2 emissions decrease with bank market power up to a threshold level beyond which a less competitive, more concentrated banking sector raises CO2 emissions. Next, we examine whether there are differences between household credit and enterprise credit and find irrelevance of credit composition. Bank lending to households or enterprises raises CO2 emissions up to a threshold above which more lending is associated with less CO2 emissions. It is also found that these effects work in part through the green technology channel. Our data thus suggest that financial reforms toward development of a more competitive, less concentrated bank-based financial system are conducive to better environmental quality. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 Elsevier B.V.\"\\n\"Fang L., Xu S.\",\"Financing equilibrium in a green supply chain with capital constraint\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081156464&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2020.106390&partnerID=40&md5=d10b93308212a535c5ce576257779918\",\"Green supply chain management has received significant attention from both academic and industrial fields with the development of ecological economics. However, the fact that upstream manufacturers may have insufficient capital for greening and operational decisions is ignored. This study investigates a green supply chain financing (GSCF) system consisting of one capital-constrained manufacturer, one retailer, and one bank. A green manufacturer can obtain loans through two financing scenarios: green credit financing (GCF) and mixed financing (combining a partial prepayment from the retailer and GCF). We derive the financing equilibriums of the GSCF system under GCF and mixed financing, then compare them against a benchmark under which the manufacturer has sufficient capital to invest in green production. The analytical and numerical results reveal that the manufacturer is willing to undertake green investment, while the retailer is better off providing a partial prepayment. However, when the consumer\\'s environmental awareness is relatively lower or the manufacturer\\'s initial capital is relatively higher, the manufacturer is not willing to accept the prepayment due to the squeeze from the retailer. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Valderrama C.V., Santibanez-Gonz\\xc3\\xa1lez E., Pimentel B., Candia-V\\xc3\\xa9jar A., Canales-Bustos L.\",\"Designing an environmental supply chain network in the mining industry to reduce carbon emissions\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078199881&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2019.119688&partnerID=40&md5=175b8137687f54df69bf0ff850b34e88\",\"An important concern in the mining industry is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across all their processes in the supply chain (SC). A good supply chain network design (SCND) involving environmental strategic challenges allows dealing with this problem. Since the literature about SCND in the mining industry is scarce, in this paper we address a multi-echelon, multi-period and multi-product environmental mining SCND with the objective to reduce GHG emissions under Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), along with minimizing investment, transportation, operating costs and carbon credits costs resulting by ETS. To solve this problem, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model that considers the location of capacitated facilities in the SC, addressing specific mining problems related to the ore grade available in mining fronts and the customer demand satisfaction in terms of quality and quantity, through additional processes such as blending and beneficiation that occurs along the several echelons of the mining SC. Our model integrates, for the first time the environmental impacts of ore grade on the mining SCND. Taking a base case inspired in a iron ore mining real-world scenario, several instances were generated to validate the proposed model. The results suggested that when the ore grade is included in the SC design, different configurations with direct effects on costs and emissions of equivalent carbon dioxide are obtained; in addition, the ETS showed to be a valid option for reducing both costs and the environmental impact along the SC. Finally, we analyze the environmental and economic impact in front of ore grade and carbon credit price variations to find managerial insights that can help decision-makers in this sector. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Srinivasa Rao U., Srimannarayana N., Veeranjaneyulu M., Balaji Prakash G.\",\"Indian financial services are \\xe2\\x80\\x98going green\\xe2\\x80\\x99\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084418604&partnerID=40&md5=c092b833bf0a6f2e36c6b1257d9dcbe1\",\"At present \\xe2\\x80\\x98GOING GREEN\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is the one of the important approach following by financial institutions.

Scholars now focus more on energy conservation, emission reduction and sustainable development of real estate companies in their current research. The data used by this paper are three-year panel data from 2015 to 2018, with observations from 15 representative real estate companies. CO2 and green credit index are introduced as the undesirable output and the green output of real estate companies respectively. First, with the DEA model and the Malmquist index model, this paper evaluates the green productivity of real estate companies statically and dynamically. The Tobit model is then employed by the author to analyze factors that may affect green productivity. Our results indicate that (1) the green productivities of 15 Chinese real estate companies have improved by various degrees. The average green productivity rises from 0.701 in 2015 to 0.849 in 2018, indicating that the energy utilization rate of enterprises has gradually increased. From the calculation and decomposition of the Malmquist total factor productivity index, we know that technological progress is vital in improving the green productivity of real estate companies. (2) As for the influencing factors, the green productivity is positively related to factors such as policy compliance indicator P, environmental responsibility commitment indicator R, indicator of green innovation capability I, and indicator of green development information disclosure M. The asset-liability ratio on the contrary has a negative impact on green productivity. It\\'s worth to point out that the green innovation index and green productivity is significantly correlated and the correlation coefficient can be up to 0.636, which implies that the key to improving green productivity is to increase research and development investment. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 by the authors.\"\\n\"Wheatcroft E., Wynn H., Lygnerud K., Bonvicini G., Leonte D.\",\"The role of low temperature waste heat recovery in achieving 2050 goals: A policy positioning paper\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084109162&doi=10.3390%2fen13082107&partnerID=40&md5=2bbc31aaa23eb5a26f4ae30b9b623e80\",\"Urban waste heat recovery, in which low temperature heat from urban sources is recovered for use in a district heat network, has a great deal of potential in helping to achieve 2050 climate goals. For example, heat from data centres, metro systems, public sector buildings and waste water treatment plants could be used to supply 10% of Europe\\'s heat demand. Despite this, at present, urban waste heat recovery is not widespread and is an immature technology. Based on interviews with urban waste heat stakeholders, investors interested in green investments, and experience from demonstrator projects, a number of recommendations are made. It is suggested that policy raising awareness of waste heat recovery, encouraging investment and creating a legal framework should be implemented. It is also recommended that pilot projects should be promoted to help demonstrate technical and economic feasibility. A pilot credit facility is suggested aimed at bridging the gap between potential investors and heat recovery projects. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

In order to optimize this structure, the Chinese government has clearly proposed to upgrade the industrial structure by solving funding problems in the field of environmental protection in the 13th 5-year plan. However, there are no systematic researches on how green credit affects industrial structure and what the corresponding effects are in the current theoretical circle. Therefore, by analyzing current situations of green credit and the industrial structure, this research explores mechanisms concerning the effects of green credit on the industrial structure. Furthermore, this study conducts an empirical research by using a fixed effects model constructed based on sample data from eastern, central, and western China from 2006 to 2016. The results find that (1) green credit mainly influences the industrial structure through capital and funding channels of enterprises. (2) On the whole, China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s green credit has significant effects on the transformation of the industrial structure. (3) Influences of green credit in China on the industrial structure are significantly different in each region. In order to effectively upgrade the industrial structure, for the related stakeholders, some effective ways are to establish a sound legal system for green credit, raise depth of understanding on green credit, and implement green credit according to local conditions. \\xc2\\xa9 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\"\\n\"Marzouk M.\",\"Fuzzy monte carlo simulation optimization for selecting materials in green buildings\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084182254&doi=10.3846%2fjeelm.2020.12087&partnerID=40&md5=255353efaf3d521431c2ebde80c048e8\",\"Global interest in sustainable and green building design has been increasing in the last few decades. This interest is strengthened by the fact that sustainable measures help in reducing negative social and environmental impacts of buildings. For that, this paper aims to develop a mixed integer optimization model that aids architects/designers and owner representatives during design stage in selecting building materials taking into consideration costs and risks that are involved in the selection process. The model is developed as a simulation optimization tool based on the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system for new construction. The developed model allows deterministic and probabilistic cost analysis of various design alternatives. In addition, it identifies the least possible cost to gain the LEED credits and the risks associated with materials\\xe2\\x80\\x99 quantities and materials\\xe2\\x80\\x99 unit prices. To illustrate the use of the proposed tool, a case study of an office building project constructed in Egypt is presented. An integrated Fuzzy Monte Carlo Simulation (FMCS) analysis is performed to account for the associated risks of using new materials in the considered case study. The proposed model is capable to capture the cost uncertainty of building materials and to identify the cost and sustainability performance of various building materials by relating the LEED rating system for new construction. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 The Author(s).\"\\n\"Ajambo S., Mbabazi E.G., Nalunga A., Kikulwe E.M.\",\"Gender roles and constraints in the green cooking banana value chain: Evidence from southwestern Uganda\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082522104&doi=10.17660%2fActaHortic.2020.1272.17&partnerID=40&md5=724c108996ae63c775ad2cbf5233d814\",\"This paper provides an overview of how women and men engage in the green cooking banana value chain (VC) and the specific constraints they face. Several recommendations for gender-responsive interventions are made. Results are based on quantitative and qualitative data collected in 2015 in southwestern Uganda in the districts of Rakai and Isingiro from actors along the VC via surveys, key informant interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs), seasonal calendars and daily activity schedules. Results show that the green cooking banana VC is dominated by men, with only 30% of the actors in the VC being women. Social norms and business entry requirements pose major constraints to women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s participation in this VC. Men and women are involved in various roles along the VC, with some roles mostly performed by men and others by women. Production is majorly controlled by men, who own and oversee most of the plantation management and sales. A few women own plantations, and acreage is usually smaller (1.5 ha) than that of men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plantations (2.4 ha). Women dominate the retail node (70%) but are absent at the wholesale node. The retail node is characterized by the highest PHL (18.42%) and the lowest profit margins. Men retailers incur higher physical (8.45%) and residual (UGX 10.084.5) losses compared to women retailers (physical (7.35); residual (UGX 9.112.5)). Women mainly access credit from informal sources that do not require collateral such as farmers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 groups. We recommend promoting evidence-based advocacy of women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rights to land, and developing strategies aimed at developing financial products, such as loans, that respond to the needs of women farmers.

Also in this study two game theoretic models have been analyzed where, in the first model the market demand depends on green degree of the produced products and selling price of the retailer, whereas for second model, demand depends not only on green degree and selling price of the retailer but also on the credit period, offered by the retailer to the customers. Here, the manufacturer produces green products and his/her production cost depends on green degree of the products and after that s/he wholesales the products on a mark-up based on his/her production cost, while the retailer decides his/her mark-up based on manufacturer\\'s wholesale price for Model I and for Model II s/he decides the mark-up on the basis of both wholesale price and the credit period. All models have been solved by considering three decision scenarios as centralized, decentralized and revenue sharing contract. Under revenue sharing contract, through numerical investigations we reveal that not only Model II gives better profit structure for both manufacturer and retailer compared to Model I but also for Model II a win-win situation can be achieved, though the contract is unable to improve the green degree of the product. We have also analyzed, how retailer can improve his/her individual profit structure along with other supply chain members by offering credit period. Finally, sensitivity analysis has been performed with respect to some key demand sensitivity parameters and retailer\\'s interest loss rate due to offered credit period to make important insights on several optimal decisions. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"McArthur J.J., Powell C.\",\"Health and wellness in commercial buildings: Systematic review of sustainable building rating systems and alignment with contemporary research\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078559055&doi=10.1016%2fj.buildenv.2019.106635&partnerID=40&md5=840399d04cecf0c346ea6bee33d7e099\",\"While sustainability rating systems for buildings have been established for nearly 20 years, systems to specifically recognize healthy buildings are much more recent arrivals to the global scene.

In this paper, we proposed a capacity/credit trading (CT) method that allows city LPs with favorable landuse conditions to build more GIs than required and trade their extra capacity as monetary credit to LPs with building difficulties; this will allow the whole city area to achieve general stormwater mitigation goal in a more cost effective way. We investigated the effects of CT on cost reduction and (re)distribution of GIs among LPs over different trading scales, and an optimization model was constructed on the basis of different zoning of CT. The model was applied to determine GI distributions among individual LPs in order to minimize the overall cost. With a case study, we demonstrated that, without CT, requiring individual LPs to meet the mitigation goal on their own can be costly, and the cost grows with implementation pressure from storm runoff reduction; engaging CT for GI implementation reduced the cost significantly even at a small trading scale. Our analysis showed that, cost increment for GI implementation can be cut in half by performing CT at a spatial scale of 500\\xe2\\x80\\x93600 m that includes 5\\xe2\\x80\\x936 LPs; when the CT trading zone is expanded to 1200 m that include 17 LPs, the cost increment can be cut by 3/4. The benefit of CT is obtained by re-distributing GIs among different LPs; but the spatial scale of CT needs to be limited to preserve the virtue of onsite treatment of stormwater with GIs. The proposed approach can be used to take advantage of the city landuse diversities to lower the overall cost of GI implementation for stormwater management. \\xc2\\xa9 2020, Springer Nature B.V.\"\\n\"Powell R.J., Vo D.H.\",\"A comprehensive stability indicator for banks\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079435167&doi=10.3390%2frisks8010013&partnerID=40&md5=62eafd0a026ce3a9ea6b3fcd56d953c4\",\"Stability indicators are essential to banks in order to identify instability caused by adverse economic circumstances or increasing risks such as customer defaults.

Ninety different parameters were identified. They were classified into four major IEQ components defining the thermal, acoustic and visual environments, and indoor air quality (IAQ). For the thermal environment, the most commonly used parameters were PMV, PPD, room operative temperature, room air temperature, room air relative humidity, and air speed. For the acoustic environment, the most commonly used parameters were ambient noise and reverberation time. For the visual environment, the most commonly used parameters were illuminance level, daylight factor, and spatial daylight autonomy. For IAQ, the most commonly used parameters were ventilation rate (outdoor air supply rate), TVOC, formaldehyde, CO2, CO, PM10, PM2.5, ozone, benzene, and radon.

Government-sponsored programs exist for low-income households while traditional financing serves creditworthy households. However, there remains a coverage gap for those with moderate incomes too high to qualify for low- income programs, but without access to friendly capital. With limited research in this space, this study aims to: (1) develop a model to estimate the number of households in the coverage gap; and (2) explore their spatial distribution. For the state of Michigan, we used data from the US Census Bureau and approximately 12,000 green bank loans to estimate the energy efficiency financing coverage gap across the state\\'s 83 counties using a binomial mixed model. We found that credit score and income interacted to largely determine whether an applicant was approved. Households in the highest income quintile achieved a 50% chance of approval with a moderate credit score (662) while those in the lowest needed a very high credit score (715) for the same odds. Overall, this created an estimated 12% energy efficiency financing coverage gap of households statewide, with individual county levels between 0% and 24%. Broadly, understanding the market potential and spatial distribution of this coverage gap could allow impact-driven financiers such as green banks or community development financial institutions to expand programs that may offer alternative underwriting criteria. Expanding loan access to this underserved market can promote energy system improvements, policy goals, household living conditions, and an equitable clean energy transition. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Aggarwal A.K., Syed A.A., Garg S.\",\"Diffusion of residential RT solar \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is lack of funds the real issue?\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074439896&doi=10.1108%2fIJESM-02-2019-0004&partnerID=40&md5=9a9df2620378eaf635f69b12e9dfd5e5\",\"Purpose: Rooftop (RT) solar in India has grown to 4.4 GW by the end of March 2019 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but it is still under-performing vs national solar mission target of 40 GW.

As a result, Green Star in Australia requires building envelopes to be insulated properly. Further, green buildings require at least 15% above the required R-values (which are measured in m2 K/W) for achieving Green Star credit points. Thermal insulation of the roof depends on various factors such as insulation material, sarking material, air films and roof covering. Therefore, there are many options with different combinations available to obtain the required total R-values. This research aims to identify optimum solutions for roofing solutions considering the life-cycle cost. There are ten commonly used roof types in Australia. Therefore, this research calculated the life-cycle costs using the net present value technique for more than 2000 options of roofing solutions and selected optimum solutions for each climate zone in Australia. The outcome shows that the initial cost and the replacement cost significantly influence the life-cycle cost. Further, the maintenance, replacement and disposal costs vary from 47 to 69% of the life-cycle cost. Sensitivity analysis concludes that the discounting rate has a significant influence on the life-cycle cost of the roofing solution. However, the changes in labour rate have only a slight impact on the life-cycle cost of roofing solutions. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 ICE Publishing.

Generally, the sustainability analysis is mostly conducted at the end of the design stage, once their components and elements have already been selected. However, achieving an integrated sustainable design solution prior to construction means that the design team must manage reciprocal task interdependencies when making decisions related to the selection of the most suitable design alternative that will lead to sustainable and efficient buildings. This study describes a methodology to automate the process sustainability assessment for proposed buildings by integrating Building Information Model (BIM) and LEED certification system while providing a framework to calculate the credits that building could potentially earn at the conceptual stage. This research aims to propose an integrated methodology that links BIM with green building certification systems at the early design stage of a project\\'s life. A plug-in is developed to calculate and predict the potential accumulated LEED credits with access to the Application Program Interface (API) of the BIM tool, energy analysis and lighting simulation tool, Google Map and their associated library. The plug-in uses K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) data mining method to estimate the missing credits, which could not be calculated directly from design specifications, to propose the whole scale innovative green building evaluation interface for building projects. \\xc2\\xa9 2019\"\\n\"Patel D.M., Kodgire P., Dwivedi A.H.\",\"Low temperature oxidation of carbon monoxide for heat recuperation: A green approach for energy production and a catalytic review\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075422962&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2019.118838&partnerID=40&md5=6ce687cc13cb96426926a69ed04108e3\",\"Low-temperature catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide has been broadly studied in literature in the view of air purification, recovery of hydrogen and reduction of industrial stack emissions. However, neither of the previously studied articles has reported the oxidation of carbon monoxide for capturing the heat generated in the exothermic reaction and simultaneously utilizing the carbon dioxide for producing chemical/petrochemical products. Thus, the current article unprecedentedly occupies an important place in literature that discusses various aspects of low-temperature oxidation of carbon monoxide for heat recuperation. The present work has identified carbon monoxide as a potential heat generator and thereby also unparallely proposed a novel zero carbon emission or NERS process to use carbon monoxide as a fuel in various industries for energy generation. In order to select the best suitable catalyst for mitigating the activation energy barrier associated with oxidation of carbon monoxide, a meticulous selection process is described with chronological and categorical literature review, and thereby concentrating the scattered literature and simultaneously alleviating the complexities involved in the catalyst selection procedure. A techno-economic analysis of the proposed NERS process is also provided with additional discussion on the benefits of carbon credits in order to confer the potential to scale up the process. Thus, the article describes a novel and a cleaner approach for the production of energy in order to take an important step towards sustainable development. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Sapkota Y., White J.R.\",\"Carbon offset market methodologies applicable for coastal wetland restoration and conservation in the United States: A review\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074658362&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2019.134497&partnerID=40&md5=b8e47ac7433df1c670e33a98ffc1f8c6\",\"Coastal wetlands have been valued for a variety of ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and long term storage. The carbon sequestered and stored in coastal habitat including mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds is termed as blue carbon. However, these systems are threatened mainly due to sea level rise, limited sediment supply, edge erosion, and anthropogenic influences. These habitats require restoration and conservation to continue providing ecosystem services. The incentive for emission reductions, referred to as carbon offsets, is well established for other ecosystems like forestry and agriculture. Some blue carbon offset methodologies or protocols have been certified by various voluntary carbon markets; however to date, a few wetland restoration carbon offset in the US has been transacted. Thus, the goal of this paper is to discuss the existing carbon market and carbon market methodologies applicable to coastal wetland restoration and conservation in the US. Currently, four wetland carbon offset methodologies have been approved in the carbon market. These methodologies are site and/or project-specific depending on the type of the wetlands, vulnerability to loss, and restoration need. The appropriate carbon stock and Green House Gas (GHG) emission assessment is the basis of determining carbon offsets. Simplification of the existing methodologies and development of new site and project-specific methodologies could potentially help to realize blue carbon offsets in practice. The slowly growing demand for carbon offsets in the carbon market could potentially be fulfilled from the blue carbon pool. While this carbon offset is in the early stages, this review may help the inclusion of carbon offset component in the coastal restoration and conservation projects in United States and potentially across the globe. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 Elsevier B.V.\"\\n\"Curry I.R.\",\"The Green New Deal Must Preserve the Existing Nuclear Fleet\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077157112&doi=10.1080%2f10406026.2020.1690227&partnerID=40&md5=766dcdd2efab9a57adddb9b349716f10\",\"As the largest source of carbon-free energy in the United States, nuclear energy must play a vital role in reducing emissions.

This research study analyzes the locational and demographic attributes of 246 proposed, completed, and/or in progress LEED-ND sites to better understand whether LEED-ND and its ratings system are achieving its goal of promoting greater social equity. This study analyzes the temporal changes of eight demographic variables that are indicative of neighborhood gentrification. These variables include educational attainment, median income, median rent, median land values, household size, median age, percent non-white, and racial diversity. Statistically significant changes to educational attainment, median rent, and diversity were observed at various geographic levels. It was also determined that the effects of LEED-ND developments are likely felt beyond the physical boundaries of the sites. The findings suggest that LEED-ND developments may function as catalysts of neighborhood gentrification rather than promoting greater social equity. \\xc2\\xa9 2019, \\xc2\\xa9 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\"\\n\"Ji T., Xu X., Yan X., Yu Y.\",\"The production decisions and cap setting with wholesale price and revenue sharing contracts under cap-and-trade regulation\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069052760&doi=10.1080%2f00207543.2019.1641239&partnerID=40&md5=a8d235cdad343930ce184b61bd17817c\",\"After consideration of a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, this paper uses a two-stage Stackelberg game to explore the production decision as well as the government cap setting with wholesale price and revenue sharing contracts under cap-and-trade regulation.

These innovations ultimately aim to create a sustainable society. Yet, the integration and syncing of relatively large amount of increasing interconnection may become a challenge related to the conventional centralised grid structure. Similarly, protection and confidentiality problems in the utilization and trade of electricity statistics pose significant challenges to implementation of the smart grid. Therefore, from its centralised form, the smart grid undergoes a transition from its centralised form to the decentralised topology.

We studied a range of recent blockchain centred research works accessible in various literature dealing with safety concerns associated in smart grid idea in order to be solved by blockchain. It also summarises a range of similar realistic designs, trials and solutions that have recently emerged. Use case in each area is studied to identify effective blockchain architecture, type of block structure and associated technologies. The energy trading process can be enhanced by using credit-based payment system. Effective record aggregation systems using blockchain technology needs to be considered to solve the confidentiality and safety problems of the grid. Energy allocation systems can distantly manage the power stream in a specific region by tracking the usage data for that sector by blockchain.

The credit of increasing coffee production and consumption goes to its alluring organoleptic characteristics. The organoleptic or final cup quality characteristic of coffee is a multifactorial and complex trait, and both agricultural and postharvest processing factors influence this multifaceted trait significantly. Agroproduction technology of coffee influences 40% cup quality attributes of coffee beverage, whereas remaining 60% quality attributes are determined by postharvest processing technology. In this chapter, the relationship of organoleptic or final cup quality attributes with agricultural and environmental factors was reviewed. The analysis focused on how these factors affect the physical quality attributes of coffee beans in addition to the biochemical cup quality attributes. An overview of agricultural and environmental factors of coffee identified a critical impact of these factors in determining the physical and biochemical cup quality attributes. Geographical topography (especially altitude, slope of attitude, its steepness) was found to be the major element which also dictated the scope of influence of subsequent agricultural and environmental factors. Coffee verities or genetics, rainfall, frost, temperature, soil fertilization status, sun and shade ecosystems, and harvesting strategies played a decisive role in shaping not only the final physical and biochemical cup quality attributes but also in postharvest processing approaches. Each coffee variety (both C. arabica and C. robusta) is specified to a specific region with a set of its own inherent quality characteristics which played an important role in the production of certified specialty, organic, or other same kind of coffees.

Banking system is the success stories, based on financial elements, the banking market is increasingly growing, but in this research, we analyze and conclude the orientation of banks, through their mission, vision, policies and financial reports in supporting the activities that have environmental impact, based on digitalization of services and financing with green loans, in order to finance clients who have their own investment plans in environmental care In addition to the research of this problematic, also we treat citizens\\' opinions as clients and businesses of the banking sector to reach conclusions on how they can influence the safeguarding of the environment through banking services. The data will be processed through SPSS program, from which we will generate and analyze statistical results. This paper is of great importance because it will contribute to fostering the banking system to adapt their policies and strategies in environmental care. It is also directly related to the reduction of banking business costs in general. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

They provide an efficient mechanism to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by monetizing the reduction in emissions. This reduction in emissions of fishing boat diesel engine such as CO, CO2 and NOX from the values of diesel was converted into carbon credits for diesel-ethanol-bio-diesel blends with nano additives. These blends with nano additives such as alumina doped ceria-zirconia provides an excellent opportunity for mitigation of Green House Gas (GHG) emission and reducing global warming for fishing boat diesel engines. A study was undertaken to calculate Global Warming Mitigation Potential (GMP) and thereby earning carbon credit from running the engine using diesel-ethanol-bio-diesel blends with nano additives. The reduction in global warming should encourage policy makers to promote ethanol to combat climate change and integration of carbon revenues will help the fishing industry. The study reveals that, carbon credits were estimated as Rs 72626.42 per tCO2 for the blends with nano additives as per the norms of the Kyoto protocol. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.\"\\n\"Golbazi M., Aktas C.B.\",\"Leed certification and patient wellbeing in green healthcare facilities\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097531862&doi=10.3992%2fjgb.15.4.3&partnerID=40&md5=5f496edba0b7dc487513238b4be88f54\",\"Beyond resource efficiencies, green buildings aim to create healthy indoor environments for building occupants. In terms of improving occupant well-being, a unique case emerges for healthcare facilities, whose patients may be at a vulnerable state.

This means the design and construction of multi-family rental buildings have potential health impacts for low-income families. The low-income-housing-tax-credit (LIHTC) federal program, administrated by state housing finance agencies, provides a policy system that can improve building quality, potentially influencing occupant health. Recent assessments on LIHTC\\'s criteria showed the effectiveness of this program to advance better-quality housing. However, there is no study on IAQ-related criteria for building design and construction (BDC) of LIHTC buildings. This paper aims to assess the IAQ implementation process, to explore what practices developers utilized and how these practices improved IAQ. Using a qualitative approach, one case study of a rehabilitation project in Washington, DC, is analyzed. A 2014-study showed IAQ improvements in this project after renovation. Semi-structured interviews with the developer of this LIHTC-project revealed that ventilation is the most challenging IAQ strategy for a rehabilitation project. The project utilized integrative design and multi-criteria decision making as the practical tools for IAQ implementation practices.

A feasibility analysis of this kind of move has been studied by performing techno-economic-environmental analysis of a four-layered SCN using second generation lignocellulose bio mass as feedstock. Using supply chain flow decisions as continuous variables and the existence and connectivity between the nodes among nodes in several echelons as binary variables, overall net present value of the supply chain network is maximized using transport, storage, production and import as operating expenditure and infrastructure as capital expenditure. The overall objective function also considered the revenue generation from selling the final product and also from the carbon credits via greenhouse gas emission savings throughout the project life cycle assessment. External imports are allowed to meet the unmet demand and maintain the product quality in terms of research octane number. With ~80% increase in demand in bioethanol and ~37% increase in biodiesel over the 9-year planning horizon, a dynamically changing SC structure coming as an outcome of the aforementioned mixed integer linear programming framework shows overall ~88% increase in the newly added locations. Further analysis shows that at least 40% of the feed supply should be provided to meet the all-time demand and keep the project alive. \\xc2\\xa9 2020, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

One of the primary policy tools contemplated by governments was the introduction of (or increase in) a carbon tax to penalize firms producing greenhouse gas emissions, potentially impacting their financial performance and affecting their creditworthiness. Financial regulators in several jurisdictions plan to include climate-linked scenarios in the annual bank stress testing exercise. In this paper, we introduce a valuation-based approach to estimate how energy transition risk may impact the creditworthiness of public companies globally within the next thirty years. Leveraging company-specific carbon dioxide emissions, country-and industry-specific carbon tax scenarios and a market-driven probability of default model covering approximately 34 000 companies globally, we perform an empirical analysis incorporating both transition-related risks and opportunities. Our findings suggest that the utilities, materials, energy and consumer staples sectors may be the most default-prone industries over a fast transition. In addition, several large-revenue companies in these sectors may default on their debt obligations over the next thirty years, potentially inducing important ripple effects in the economy, at both a national and a global level. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.\"\\n\"Vera F.\",\"Unlocking oilfield development using blockchain\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090508511&partnerID=40&md5=811f40c4a4e280578400c5e8617a18fc\",\"Many operators and service providers integrate oilfield data in the form of data hubs. Third party vendors often control these data hubs in the oil and gas industry, and data quality is often challenged. The digital gentrification of legacy wells and optimization of subsurface data management for exploration is at reach by applying smart technology ledgers, better known as blockchain. Blockchain technology provides a platform to keep all data linked. The data is smoothly shared among different groups like exploration, drilling, completion and production. Over time, some data might be lost of which the inheriting company might not be aware. If all the data is loaded onto the blockchain, it becomes easy to track. When we deal with subsurface analysis in offset well analysis, the data of all wells in a field (or a nearby field) readily become available on a blockchain database to assist in better decision-making. The data generated are stored in blockchain and can act as historical data in the future to better train models and assist in making informed decisions in both green and brown fields, as in subsurface analysis. For instance, a reservoir characterization project or a determination of landing zone progresses smoother when all historical data are available for review. Another opportunity for blockchain is in the field of legacy wells. When acquisition of wells happens, the inheriting company receives data, and some of which is still in traditional paper report format. Over time, inheriting companies might not be aware of the risk of losing 25 to 40% of these legacy data. If all this data is loaded onto the blockchain, it becomes easier to track the history of these legacy wells, and they can be better optimized. On production inventories, the immediate effect translates in the real time quantification of reported production and the inventories, which have an instantaneous effect on the price of commodities like WTI crude or Brent crude instead of waiting longer to correct estimated values. The carbon negative narrative also offers a unique opportunity to connect private investors with operator leadership. As capital is at a premium to sustain development campaigns in the Permian basin and as more incentives in the form of tax credits become available for CO2 injection, investors need a tool to sustain the trust where they deploy their capital. By generating smart contracts in blockchain as a medium to elevate trust and involve players immediately as they report volumes of CO2 injected, they have a first view at how many tax credit incentives they become eligible to claim. Application of Blockchain represents an opportunity for digital gentrification across upstream, midstream and downstream in the energy sector. It also acts as a tool to connect and accelerate environmental efforts. The quicker its adoption, the larger the benefits and profits become.

Higher-level green buildings in planned outer business districts are attracting tenants from the CBD to Navi Mumbai, especially those in sectors with intensive human-capital needs. The driver for tenants demanding higher-level green buildings is the signalling benefits associated with green buildings.

On the other hand, REs especially the Variable Renewable Energies (VREs) like wind and solar power suffer from intermittency in its output generation. This intermittency can introduce severe technical and economic problems for the power systems with high penetration from these energies. This intermittency should be mitigated not only during the system operation phase but also during power system planning phase. For this purpose, the classical power system planning methodologies and models should be upgraded to account for this intermittency in a way to find the optimum solutions to mitigate it. In this regard, this paper will focus on developing a new Generation Expansion Planning (GEP) model to find the optimum mix of dispatchable generation technologies that can allow the integration of VREs into the power system while mitigating the technical and economic impacts of its intermittency. In addition, a number of new concepts related to generation mix flexibility, VREs capacity credit and role of system operating reserve in integrating VREs will be revisited. Then, the developed GEP model will be applied to a case study handling the future expansion scenarios of VREs in the Egyptian grid.

Counterintuitively, results show that the wholesale price is negatively related to the cost rate of green technology development. To fill the considerable performance gap between the Stackelberg equilibrium and the centralised supply chain system, a two-part tariff contract is designed to bring the decentralised supply chain into full coordination. This paper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main contribution lies in proposing a two-part tariff contract that coordinates the green supply chain, and analysing the economic and social impacts on the green supply chain.

To assess if historical redlining, the US government\\'s 1930s racially discriminatory grading of neighborhoods\\' mortgage credit-worthiness, implemented via the federally sponsored Home Owners\\' Loan Corporation (HOLC) color-coded maps, is associated with contemporary risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks gestation). Methods. We analyzed 2013-2017 birth certificate data for all singleton births in New York City (n = 528 096) linked by maternal residence at time of birth to (1) HOLC grade and (2) current census tract social characteristics. Results. The proportion of preterm births ranged from 5.0% in grade A (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d-green) to 7.3% in grade D (\\xe2\\x80\\x9chazardous\\xe2\\x80\\x9d-red). The odds ratio for HOLC grade D versus A equaled 1.6 and remained significant (1.2; P <.05) in multilevel models adjusted for maternal sociodemographic characteristics and current census tract poverty, but was 1.07 (95% confidence interval = 0.92, 1.20) after adjustment for current census tract racialized economic segregation. Conclusions. Historical redlining may be a structural determinant of present-day risk of preterm birth. Public Health Implications. Policies for fair housing, economic development, and health equity should consider historical redlining\\'s impacts on present-day residential segregation and health outcomes. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 American Public Health Association Inc..

In this paper, a novel tripartite evolutionary game theory is proposed to examine the behavioral strategies of government, banks, and the grid enterprises in the low-carbon power grid technology innovation cooperation. The evolutionary replication dynamics equations are presented to study evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) of participants. The meaningful simulation results are as follows: from the subsidy perspective, even if the government subsidies are phasing out, the ESS of the low-carbon grid technology cooperation still converges to the Pareto optimal equilibrium; from the cost perspective, the higher low-carbon technology innovation cost only slows down the evolution rate, while the higher business cost of carbon asset pledge credit and the lower incentive cost not only slow down the evolution rate but also change the evolution results. It shows that the business cost of carbon asset pledge credit has a greater impact on the evolution of the system than the incentive cost; from the benefit perspective, increasing the green revenue and the successful probability of the low-carbon technology innovation can both prompt the ESS to evolve to Pareto optimal state, and the effect of the former is greater than the latter. These results provide a theoretical guidance for government to promote the development of low-carbon technology innovation of power grid. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 IEEE.\"\\n\"Taghizadeh-Hesary F., Yoshino N.\",\"Sustainable solutions for green financing and investment in renewable energy projects\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079686725&doi=10.3390%2fen13040788&partnerID=40&md5=53727ada31608a19a1f07dddc82035ac\",\"The lack of long-term financing, the low rate of return, the existence of various risks, and the lack of capacity of market players are major challenges for the development of green energy projects.

The paper aims to identify the drivers and challengers impacting the solar and wind power sectors in India through an expert survey. Thirty-four sector experts representing ministries, federal agencies, renewable companies, investor groups, financial institutions and civil society responded to a questionnaire using a \\xe2\\x80\\x98Likert Scale\\xe2\\x80\\x99, encompassing all possible factors which would have influenced these two sectors. Response depicted an even distribution of score, with experts endorsing policies like feed-in-tariff, auctions and tax depreciation and the requirement of a strong grid network to assimilate variable power. Commercial and infrastructure variables like cost of capital, credit worthiness of utility, land and road network were marked high. Experts envisaged heightened role of green power in future which may have to compete in open power markets sans any policy support.

The specific scope of this work is the nexus formed by the SDGs 2, 6 and 7 which deal with agribusiness, water management and renewable, reliable and affordable energy respectively. These three goals merge perfectly in the case of solar PV powered water pumps which can work for human consumption and irrigation. In a country such as Kenya where 75% plus of the population still live in rural areas and are deprived of both electricity and water, the lack of such basic resources drives people to an economy of subsistence with little or no surplus to generate income. In order to develop a sector there is a fundamental need to build capacity. That is why Strathmore Energy Research Centre (SERC) has, with the help of industry, developed a syllabus for theoretical and practical training on how to design, install and maintain such systems in different sizes. This initiative attracted NGO (Non-Governmental Organizations) such as Oxfam, Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to partner and fund the training course. SERC has built a hands-on kit such that once gone through the course, participants are fully prepared to implement such units all over the geography of Kenya and other countries around. This nonetheless does not tell the whole story as aspects related to awareness amongst the rural population, access to line of credit and suitable regulations are also essential aspects required for adequate penetration of this specific technology. This paper thus analyses the holistic setting up of an ecosystem which has a potential to transform rural economy and eventually reduce urban migration. \\xc2\\xa9 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\"\\n\"de Jong M.D.T., Huluba G., Beldad A.D.\",\"Different Shades of Greenwashing: Consumers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Reactions to Environmental Lies, Half-Lies, and Organizations Taking Credit for Following Legal Obligations\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073983986&doi=10.1177%2f1050651919874105&partnerID=40&md5=3545fe534235b6e8cf518aad7c67e7e9\",\"Although corporate greenwashing is a widespread phenomenon, few studies have investigated its effects on consumers.

This article describes a randomized 3 \\xc3\\x97 2 experimental study in the cruise industry investigating the effects of various degrees of greenwashing. Six experimental conditions were created based on behavioral-claim greenwashing (an organization telling the truth vs. its telling lies or half-lies) and motive greenwashing (an organization acting on its own initiative vs. its taking credit for following legal obligations). Dependent variables were three corporate reputation constructs: environmental performance, product and service quality, and financial performance. Compared to true green behavior, lies and half-lies had similar negative effects on reputation. Taking credit for following legal obligations had no main effect. Only in the case of true green behavior did undeservedly taking credit affect reputation negatively. Overall, the findings suggest that only true green behavior will have the desired positive effects on reputation. \\xc2\\xa9 The Author(s) 2019.\"\\n[No author name available],\"15th International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing, IIH-MSP 2019, held in conjunction with the 12th International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology, Applications and Tools, FITAT 2019\",2020,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069530393&partnerID=40&md5=ce3ad55b8c91128932838d22cf5cbaaa\",\"The proceedings contain 95 papers.

LEED as one of the predominant green building rating systems sets specific daylight criterion, and offers more than one option for project teams to assess and comply with the set criterion; either using manual calculations, using computer simulation (during design), or by daylight measurement (by substantial construction). This article presents a case study of a LEED Gold building in Cairo, Egypt. Within this specific case, three daylight assessment approaches were implemented; Daylight simulation (on design drawings), daylight measurement (after substantial construction), and Post Occupancy Evaluation (POE) (after 9 months of building occupancy).

Green inventory management reduces the environmental impacts of a business without lacking its profit. This study demonstrates a fuzzy green inventory model having non-instantaneous deteriorating products which help the organizations for maximization of total annual profit under different conditions of trade-credit-policies along with minimizing carbon for a cleaner environment. The paper discusses all the potential cases, which may occur in green inventory models with carbon emission cost under different allowable delay-in-payments. Here, the demand rate is taken as dependent on selling price. In addition, shortages are allowable and are completely backlogged. The whole profit is calculated from the retailer\\'s perspective. In this model, demand, as well as deterioration rates, are considered as a triangular fuzzy number. The objective has to evaluate sustainable optimal ordering strategies for retailers, which maximize the entire annual profit and minimize the carbon emission. The various possible scenarios are discussed in detail to get the relevant profit of a retailer. The validity of the established model is proved by presenting a numerical experiment. Sensitivity analysis of this study is also exemplified to verify its factual practice. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Wirakusuma G., Irham, Hartono S., Mulyo J.\",\"Development strategies of agricultural sector toward environmental externalities: Case study in East Java, Indonesia\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077432537&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f383%2f1%2f012021&partnerID=40&md5=5b33e8233b6f986735c6d39aadbb7a02\",\"This research was conducted to measure the agricultural sector\\'s externalities and to generate a model of proper strategies to encourage sustainable economic development through the agricultural sector.

Power-to-methane is one option for sector coupling in a future energy system. Here, a techno-economic analysis is presented that investigated different pathways with eight different scenarios. The first four use renewable hydrogen via electrolysis from wind combined with different CO2 sources, i.e., from biogas production, tail gas from power plants, provided by a supplier and from direct air capture. The remaining four scenarios based on conventional hydrogen and carbon dioxide sources are considered for the sake of comprehensive coverage. For all scenarios, a process analysis provides important insights. The economic analysis shows methane costs in the range of \\xe2\\x82\\xac3.51-\\xe2\\x82\\xac3.88 per kg for all optimized process schemes on the power to gas route. Therefore, no economic benefit can be achieved for a gas provider using power-to-methane in his gas grid. Nevertheless, with regard to the GHG reduction target of 80-95% through 2050, green solutions are of special interest. The results of the ecological analysis show a highly promising pathway that makes use of liquid manure. The avoidance of fertilizing soil by dispensing large amounts of liquid manure achieves improvements in acidification and eutrophication of soil and ground water.

On this basis, an intermediary effect model of panel data is constructed to empirically analyze the intermediary effect of green financial development on renewable energy investment efficiency through bank loans, short-term loans, and long-term loans. We find that China\\'s green financial development has a negative impact on bank loan issuance in general, and inhibits the improvement of renewable energy investment efficiency to a certain extent, with an effect degree of 0.0017. Besides, the short-term loan has few intermediate effect on investment efficiency, while there is no intermediary effect of long-term loans. Moreover, as for the over-investment renewable energy enterprises, intermediary effect of bank loans exists. Green financial development can inhibit over-investment in renewable energy by reducing bank credit issuance; for renewable energy companies of under-investment, on the contrary, it aggravates the under-investment to a certain extent. This paper suggests that the government should both construct and consummate the green financial system through policies and regulation. Financial institutions should actively produce innovative green financial products and support the development of renewable energy enterprises and the renewable energy enterprises should strengthen their internal management and develop financing channels. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Taghizadeh-Hesary F., Yoshino N.\",\"The way to induce private participation in green finance and investment\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065150739&doi=10.1016%2fj.frl.2019.04.016&partnerID=40&md5=cc59c1f7a5e1b92a65169577b9479c3b\",\"Establishment of green credit guarantee schemes (GCGSs)and returning a portion of the tax revenue originally generated from spillover effect of green energy supply to investors.

However, they require greater investment than conventional buildings. Green buildings can be classified at different levels ranging through certified, silver, gold and platinum. The classification chosen is likely to affect project costs. Adopting a platinum level of green building specifications tends to incur the highest project costs. While with gold, silver and certified levels expenditure will be reduced accordingly. The actual degree of project cost differences also depends on additional factors, such as site location, design specifications, construction condition, material and equipment selection and LEED consultant expertise. Construction budgeting represents a crucial factor for project owners developing green buildings. This research presents a method for determining the minimum project costs of green building developments. The processes and steps to be completed in determining such minimum project costs are presented based on a case study of a learning centre building which received LEED platinum certification. It was found that choosing certified and silver levels has an indifferent effect on project costs, whereas expenditure increases exponentially with gold and platinum levels of certification. \\xc2\\xa9 2019, College Publishing.

A reasonable risk premium is the key to the successful issuance and trading of green bonds. Therefore, this paper studies the factors affecting the risk premium of China\\'s green bond issuance, aiming to provide a basis for determining a more reasonable risk premium. Based on the primary issuance market of green bonds, this paper takes into account the macro- and microscopic cross-sectional data of green bond issuance and comprehensively considers the main factors affecting the green bond risk premium from macro-influence factors, micro-influence factors, and green attribute factors. An empirical study of the factors affecting the risk premium of China\\'s green bond issuance was conducted using multivariate statistical regression analysis. The study found that the green attribute factor affecting the risk premium of green bonds is third-party green assessment certification. The bond factors affecting the risk premium of green bond issuance mainly include debt credit rating, issue period, and issue size, all of which affect the risk of green bond issuance. The issuer factors affecting the risk premium of green bonds include debt principal, nature of property rights, and return on net assets. The macro factor affecting the risk premium of green bonds is the current market interest rate. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 by the authors.\"\\n\"Yeganeh A.J., McCoy A.P., Hankey S.\",\"Green affordable housing: Cost-benefit analysis for zoning incentives\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075820655&doi=10.3390%2fsu11226269&partnerID=40&md5=34bd87256a00bfd9c244128e93f11e0b\",\"In the year 2017, about 89% of the total energy consumed in the US was produced using non-renewable energy sources, and about 43% of tenant households were cost burdened. Local governments are in a unique position to facilitate green affordable housing, that could reduce cost burdens, environmental degradation, and environmental injustice. Nonetheless, limited studies have made progress on the costs and benefits of green affordable housing, to guide decision-making, particularly in small communities. This study investigates density bonus options for green affordable housing by analyzing construction costs, transaction prices, and spillover effects of green certifications and affordable housing units. The authors employ pooled cross-sectional construction cost and price data from 422 Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) projects and 11,016 Multiple Listing Service (MLS) transactions in Virginia. Using hedonic regression analyses controlling for mediating factors, the study finds that the new construction of market-rate green certified houses is associated with small upfront costs, but large and statistically significant price premiums. In addition, the construction of market-rate green certified houses has large and statistically significant spillover effects on existing non-certified houses. Existing non-certified affordable housing units show small and often insignificant negative price impacts on the transaction prices of surrounding properties. The study concludes that the magnitude of social benefits associated with green building justifies the local provision of voluntary programs for green affordable housing, where housing is expensive relative to its basic cost of production. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 by the authors.\"\\n\"Fu X., Hopton M.E., Wang X., Goddard H., Liu H.\",\"A runoff trading system to meet watershed-level stormwater reduction goals with parcel-level green infrastructure installation\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068451909&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2019.06.439&partnerID=40&md5=fcb19ec8210ce83dbe80026f4640641c\",\"Green infrastructure (GI) has been recommended widely to reduce runoff from the built environment. However, reliance on public land for GI implementation could cause a heavy financial burden on local governments. Although economic incentives and market-based mechanisms may encourage public participation in managing stormwater by installing GI on private parcels, a runoff trading market has not been fully developed in practice. To establish a market, in part, requires a watershed-based planning framework and fully informed parcel owners in regard to tradable credits, costs, and benefits. We propose a scenario-based Stormwater Management Planning Support System for Trading Runoff Abatement Credits (SMPSS-TRAC) to facilitate the calculation and allocation of stormwater runoff abatement credits in order to assist the decision-making of GI investment. We apply SMPSS-TRAC to a watershed located in Hamilton County, Ohio, USA and develop five scenarios representing increasing use of GI. We test the scenarios under a 5-year rainfall intensity and set a cap of runoff for each scenario at a level that is equal to the runoff from an undeveloped status (1.03-inch runoff depth for the watershed). With the proposed SMPSS-TRAC, the watershed authority could encourage all parcel owners to install suitable GI or purchase credits from the market. When detention basins are needed to meet a stated goal, the watershed authority would build them on vacant lots and share costs with all parcels within the same sub-catchment. The last scenario with four types of GI installed, shows that the watershed reaches market equilibrium and generates 15,358 m3 credit surplus. SMPSS-TRAC has the potential for including multiple stakeholders\\' preferences and concerns in searching for preferable scenarios. \\xc2\\xa9 2019\"\\n\"Yang F., Jiang Z.\",\"Urban building energy modelling and urban design for sustainable neighbourhood development-A China perspective\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074891266&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f329%2f1%2f012016&partnerID=40&md5=5a800440d15f84adbbdcac56ea037ad2\",\"Urban design at the neighbourhood scale has profound effects on urban microclimate, and thus on urban buildings energy consumption (in particular heating, cooling and lighting), extent of applicability of passive heating/cooling strategies, indoor/outdoor thermal comfort and street vehicle emissions dispersal (air quality). Previous studies, especially recent explorations in the emerging field of urban building energy modelling (UBEM), suggest clear neighbourhood-scale energy impact from building type, density, layout/orientation and facade/fenestration treatment. The purpose of research is to inform design, but how the research findings in urban building energy inform urban design practice is not straight-forward, in that real-world urban development involves all stakeholders and needs to take environmental, social and economical factors into account, in addition to energy and urban climate. If to support more healthy, comfortable and energy-efficient urban district/ neighbourhood is one goal of green neighbourhood development (ND) rating tools, we should investigate possibilities to further and more efficiently integrate findings of UBEM into guidelines and credits system that inform climate-responsive urban design. This paper, based on a review on recent advancement in UBEM, investigates a more comprehensive and systematic prescriptive approach in ND to optimizing urban building energy performance by moderating urban form, fabric and land cover. Although UBEM as a scientific tool is diagnostic in evaluating urban design scenarios on a case basis, prescriptive design guidelines based on good science are suitable and useful for architects in integrating urban building energy issues in practice. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

An optimized supply chain network (SCN) has been designed with four layers of structure starting from raw material suppliers to the retailers through the layers of the manufacturers and the distributors aiming at the net present value (NPV) maximization. The cost calculation includes operating expenditure (OPEX) and capital expenditure (CAPEX) components involving transport, storage, production and import decisions as linear variables and decisions on connections between two nodes between two consecutive layers as binary variables.

This study generalizes the dual-credit system (energy credit and green credit) and investigates its effects on the green technology investments (GTI) and pricing decisions in a two-echelon supply chain consisting of three possible scenarios, Case O (conventional product only), Case B (both conventional and green products), and Case G (green product only). The obtained results show that the GTI made by manufacturers follow high threshold and low threshold. The generalized dual-credit system increases both thresholds and promotes the transition from Case O to Case B and Case B to Case G. The transition is sensitive to standard energy consumption per-unit (SECP), green credit quota (GCQ), and price of green credit (PGC). The generalized dual-credit system benefits the manufacturers who exceed the low threshold, vice versa, especially for whose conventional product with lower initial energy consumption per unit.

The governance of online catering takeaway is a complex system engineering that greatly relates to the multi-agencies and multi-factors at various levels, and it needs efforts of supporters from all aspects of the society to positively participate. However, relevant theoretical research on processing takeaway trash is still rarely reported, as well as the policy and regulations, and implementations of corresponding measures. The theories and techniques that exist in system ecology and sustainable system engineering were introduced, and the AHP method was adopted to propose the impact indicators of the governance body participation. By incorporating the blockchain technology, the parallel traceability governance system based on the ACP theory and knowledge automation for online catering takeaway garbage could provide a platform of decentralized green credit. This green credit system can arouse the initiative of relevant participating bodies for effective coordination, and can also solve the problem of no experience and making decisions difficultly. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 Beijing Xintong Media Co., Ltd..

Recently, the high performance building industry has shown a trend towards prioritizing better daylighting conditions. In response to this trend, the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system now addresses daylighting and views as one of the criteria for compliance. However, effective daylighting has its challenges\\xe2\\x80\\x94most importantly addressing the issue of glare. This paper discusses the issue of glare and its relationship with requirements for effective daylighting within the criteria of the LEED rating system. In this study, a LEED certified building on Montana State University\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campus was considered as a case study. This paper conducts an analysis by comparing the results obtained from compliance procedures for LEED with independent evaluations of glare using simulation and post occupancy evaluation surveys. This paper concludes that the \\xe2\\x80\\x98illuminance simulation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 option provided in the current version of LEED (LEED v4) for compliance does not adequately address the issue of glare. This paper provides recommendations to improve the LEED rating system for indoor environmental quality which include: the incorporation of glare assessment in the evaluation procedures of daylighting and views; the use of dynamic simulations that incorporate climatic conditions in the evaluation of daylighting; and evaluating glare in early stages of design by using simulation tools. \\xc2\\xa9 2019, College Publishing.

However, the voluntary acceptance by landowners crucially depends on their economic outcome. We (i) assess the carbon sequestration potential of afforestation projects in various Chinese regions by comparing different tree species, project durations and regional particularities, (ii) analyze the costs and benefits of tree species used for timber and fruit production as well as bamboo, and (iii) compare them with alternative crops under different climatic and economic conditions. Finally, we calculate the minimum compensation required by farmers to convert cropland to forests assuming a joint production of timber or fruits and carbon sequestration. No compensation is needed when cropland with relatively low revenues is to be converted. In contrast, compensation payments must be high for converting land used for cash crops, such as sugarcane. For fruit trees, the amount of carbon sequestered is low, but selling fruits and nuts is quite profitable. Consequently, in most cases there is no compensation needed. The minimum price per carbon credit decreases with increasing project duration because more carbon is stored per hectare, and in consequence, the required payments per credit are lower. This does not hold for fast-growing trees like eucalyptus and poplar, for which the minimum price increases with extended project duration. Bamboo shows a high carbon sequestration potential, and becomes economically more attractive by including carbon revenues. Carbon credits can often compensate the opportunity costs of alternative land uses, except for afforestation on highly productive cropland. We demonstrate that the economic attractiveness of afforestation projects is strongly context dependent and varies substantially across regions. The findings can contribute to the cost-efficient design of carbon sequestration projects. The methodology can be applied to other regions in the developing world. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 by the authors.\"\\n\"Guo Q., Zhou M., Liu N., Wang Y.\",\"Spatial effects of environmental regulation and green credits on green technology innovation under low-carbon economy background conditions\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071455017&doi=10.3390%2fijerph16173027&partnerID=40&md5=448083ecd3944fef51f53919553a000e\",\"Based on the data of green credit (GC), environmental regulation (ER) and green technology innovation (GTI) in 30 provinces and cities of China from 2007 to 2016, this study investigated the relationship between green credit and green technology innovation development and analyzed the adjustment effect of ER on GC to promote GTI using Geoda and Matlab2016 software, so as to further guide and encourage GC.

The estimation results show that financial development efficiency and stock trading volume have positive impacts on CO2 emissions, while financial development scale and the market value of listed companies have negative impacts on CO2 emissions. The elasticity coefficients of the financial development variables are different for different sub-panels with different financial development. In addition, we do robustness tests by estimating the panel data model of four different sub-panels, which estimation results are consistent with the previous regression results. Finally, we suggest China\\'s policy makers the following policy implications: China\\'s government should formulate and improve financial credit policies, which can encourage financial institutions to carry out green credit business.

In practice, building services are chosen separately by different professions while they are literally interdependent on each other in determining the overall effectiveness and efficiency of green building. In addition, these building services are chosen at the initial stage without necessarily considering their life-cycle costs (LCC). A more holistic view to consider the interdependence of various building services throughout their life cycle is highly desired. Hence, this research aims to examine building services in green building by considering both their interdependence and costs throughout the building life cycle. The Hong Kong BEAM (Building Environmental Assessment Method) Plus is selected for a case study. Initially, the credits related to building services are identified and mapped from the BEAM Plus. Afterwards, LCC of the credits are calculated using the net present value technique. It is discovered that by considering building services\\' interdependence from a life cycle perspective, the choices of such building services could be much different. A significant proportion of the LCC is related to operation, maintenance and replacement of the building services, which cannot be offset by the savings of green building independently. However, there are benefits such as CO2 reductions, which can be used to make up the LCC if they can be properly monetised. The research provides significant insights to developers and their consultants in choosing cost-effective building services with a view to better realising the value of green building. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Hopkins E.\",\"Communicating environmental sustainability initiatives virtually: Taking stock of the apartment property management industry in the United States\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067003184&doi=10.1108%2fPM-07-2018-0045&partnerID=40&md5=9c8c86bb89bec5a9e1bcdccc07ff9526\",\"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to uncover the extent to which firms in the apartment property management industry in the USA are promoting green property management services via communication on their websites. Design/methodology/approach: A content analysis is the main research method for this study. Once all qualifying terms listed on the company website were recorded based on LEED credit and category, the data were synthesized to create a sustainability continuum organizing the firms based on the extent to which they communicate sustainability initiatives on their respective websites. Findings: The results demonstrate that the majority of the largest 50 apartment management firms in the USA are not communicating any sustainability initiatives on their website. In all, 52 percent of companies have no acknowledgment of sustainability initiatives on their website; 16 percent of companies provide some cursory reference to sustainability initiatives; 16 percent offer some detail on their website; 6 percent contain in-depth detail plus metrics. The remaining 10 percent of firms are providing comprehensive sustainability reporting on their websites. Practical implications: Property management companies have an immense opportunity to capitalize on showcasing their green building features via company websites. Not only does incorporating environmental sustainability practices support a climate mitigation strategy, marketing these practices can foster consumer satisfaction and a willingness to pay more.

The 2009 LEED framework allowed the certified Brazilian buildings to pursue those easier-to-obtain scores, which raises doubts about whether the LEED label push to strong sustainability since its core concept is based on energy and material consumption. Notwithstanding, the evaluated projects in Brazil pursue lower degrees of sustainability because they apply efforts in obtaining the minimum scores required by a specific label. Although demanding improvements, LEED certification should be promoted as an important tool towards sustainable development due to its innumerous advantages. \\xc2\\xa9 2019\"\\n\"Nieto M.J.\",\"Banks, climate risk and financial stability\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066885709&doi=10.1108%2fJFRC-03-2018-0043&partnerID=40&md5=4fba8cfe06b772c0e0853906d84ab595\",\"Purpose: This paper aims to quantify the (syndicated) loan exposure to elevated environmental risk sectors of the banking system in the USA, EU, China, Japan and Switzerland at US$1.6tn and to highlight its importance, which ranges from 3.8 (USA) to 0.5 per cent (China) in terms of total national banking assets. The paper highlights the relevance of exploring prudential policy responses, including a harmonized taxonomy, statistical and reporting framework that could contribute to internalizing the negative externalities associated with climate risks by both banks and their supervisors. Among the prudential supervisory tools, credit registers facilitate the assessment of environmental risk drivers in \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccarbon stress tests.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This paper also presents a framework of analysis for the regulatory treatment of climate-related risks. Design/methodology/approach: Similarly to Weyzig et al. (2014), this paper uses financial databases on the banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 role as book runners for syndicated loans; that is, as the lead arrangers who also provide a large share of the actual lending. Loans are outstanding on December 31, 2014, and the paper assumes linear amortization of loans issued before that date and with maturity after that date. This study includes the largest banks from the above-mentioned countries with financial information available in SNL Financial and EU banks with financial information available in the ECB database on December 31, 2014. By assessing the relative share of the ten largest (or total reporting if less) banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 exposure to each high environmental risk sector in relation to their total assets, these findings can be extrapolated across sectors in the respective country. Findings: This paper quantifies the loan exposure to elevated environmental risk sectors of the banking system in the USA, EU, China, Japan and Switzerland in US$1.6tn, broadly in line with the findings of Battiston et al. (2017) and Weyzig et al. (2014). This paper also explores prudential policy approaches and tools. In addition to the lack of taxonomy of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbrown\\xe2\\x80\\x9d vs \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the paper identifies the limitations to assess the risks involved in the transition to a low-carbon economy: supervisory reports that do not make full use of the existing international statistical framework (e.g. EU COREP and FINREP); lack of harmonized reporting requirements of environmental risks; lack of credit registers as tools to perform carbon stress-testing; and supervisors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 governance framework that do not internalize environmental risks (e.g. proposed revision of the Basel Core Principles of Banking Supervision). As per the stress-testing, the paper presents two examples. The paper presents a framework of analysis for the regulatory treatment of climate-related risks. The author identifies two critical elements of such framework if prudential regulation of environmental risks is to be considered: the consideration or not of climate risk as credit risk and the impact of environmental risks over probabilities of default over the entire business cycle. Research limitations/implications: No internationally accepted \\xe2\\x80\\x9cofficial\\xe2\\x80\\x9d taxonomy of high environmental risk sectors exists. This paper uses Moody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (2015a) classification of sectors according to their environmental risk exposure. This paper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exposures do not reflect the real risk exposure of these institutions and the banking industry as a whole because, as explained in Page 6, these values are without regard to bilateral loans and guarantees and securitizations of loans; in the case of loans to power generation companies, renewable sources are not excluding and, similarly, for the production of electric vehicles, loans are not excluded. Furthermore, this paper does not assess banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 exposures to sovereigns subject to high environmental risks and bonds and equity issued by corporations operating in high environmental risk sectors. Practical implications: Contribution to the present policy debate on how to regulate banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 exposure to high environmental risk and how to manage the transition to a low-carbon economy. Social implications: This paper can increase awareness of the banking sector transition risks to a low-carbon economy. Originality/value: This paper quantifies banks direct exposures to high environmental risk sectors using an ample definition of sectors exposed to environmental risk. The author suggests policy actions to assess the environmental risks. The author defines a regulatory framework for banks to internalize the negative externalities of environmental risks. \\xc2\\xa9 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.\"\\n\"Lu W., Chi B., Bao Z., Zetkulic A.\",\"Evaluating the effects of green building on construction waste management: A comparative study of three green building rating systems\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063612013&doi=10.1016%2fj.buildenv.2019.03.050&partnerID=40&md5=42e45404f9af2c6cbe066a04f90a9196\",\"The impacts of buildings on our life, business, and natural environment have fueled a global trend in the building industry to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgo green\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. This has helped proliferate various green building rating systems (GBRSs) around the world. While previous studies have examined the effects of these systems on such aspects as resources consumption, indoor air quality and property value, little research, if any, has examined their effects on construction waste management (CWM). This study aims to evaluate the effects of GBRSs on CWM, and to understand the causes behind the effects thereof ascertained. Three GBRSs, including the U.S.-developed Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Mainland China\\'s GB Evaluation Label (GBEL) and Hong Kong\\'s Building Environmental Assessment Method (BEAM Plus) are selected for comparative study. A combination of desktop archive analysis and semi-structured interviews formed the study\\'s mixed method approach. Surprisingly, the study reveals that the three GBRSs do not greatly promote superior CWM performance despite their respective CWM targeted credits. Possible causes, as informed by the interviewees, include the design of rating systems themselves, developers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 biases, and lack of incentives to improve CWM. Legal and economic incentives are more decisive drivers of responsible CWM. This paper also provides demonstrable qualitative evidence for legislators and associated bodies to achieve continued improvement in CWM via GBRSs. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Leoto R., Lizarralde G.\",\"Challenges in evaluating strategies for reducing a building\\'s environmental impact through Integrated Design\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063296984&doi=10.1016%2fj.buildenv.2019.03.041&partnerID=40&md5=0bdcfa9478815d9f03883a9501c2a41b\",\"To reduce a building\\'s impact on the environment, governments and certification boards encourage the use of innovative and collaborative design processes such as Integrated Design (ID).

Although ID\\'s potential is theoretically well-founded, there is little empirical evidence of its effectiveness. This study seeks to validate the extent to which ID effectively improves project performance in terms of its reduction of environmental impacts. Three Canadian building projects, certified LEED and integrating various environmental strategies, are examined. The research team first identified and evaluated strategies aimed at reducing the buildings\\xe2\\x80\\x99 impacts. Then, it analysed the decision-making process and measured impact reductions comparing reference buildings, schematic designs and construction documents - using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools and Building Energy Simulations (BES). Results show a 60% reduction in global warming potential (GWP) and 62% in energy consumption in the case studies. They also underline five challenges for ID practices: tool complexity and accuracy, missing information, reducing embodied energy in high-performance buildings, poor environmental design decisions, and decision-making based on green certification credits. Opportunities to overcome these challenges include deepening professionals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 knowledge of Life Cycle Assessments and developing more effective energy simulation tools.

Therefore, policies promoting the development of renewable energy are introduced. Under the condition of non-capital constraints, the green-credit policy and the production subsidy about renewable energy enterprises are compared. The results show that changes of market interest rate provide different implications for regulators to choose between the two policies. Under the condition of capital constraints, it is found that the green-credit policy has positive effect on renewable energy enterprises, and the effect enlarges when the difference between green rates and market interest rate becomes wider. With the increase of carbon tax and the negative externality of traditional energies, the capital flows into renewable energy enterprises.

The life cycle assessment was applied to evaluate the long-term environmental impact of the solar power systems on-board in replace of conventional diesel engine systems. The cost and benefit of such systems were evaluated through the economic assessment where the life cycle cost relative to installation, operation and recycling of the solar panels, fuel savings and payback time were considered. Research findings revealed the payback time would be around three years, whereas the accumulative fuel cost saving would be over $300,000 by the end of vessel life. The sensitivity analysis using two varying parameters - energy efficiency and investment cost - implied, that the longer payback time would be positively associated with lower energy efficiencies and higher investment costs. It was also suggested that the marginal cost of the carbon credit should be $ 190 per tonne or higher to make the shipping business successful. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Lee S.-E., Skorski S.\",\"Green stores: an analysis of LEED-Certified fashion stores\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067798531&doi=10.1080%2f17569370.2019.1607227&partnerID=40&md5=afee42d946e0827282196ab9d5334522\",\"The purpose of this study is to provide insight into green retail spaces for fashion brands.

Due to the significant differences in urban land use, some Land Parcels (LPs) may have difficulty in building enough GIs to meet stormwater mitigation goals. In this paper, we proposed a Capacity Trading (CT) approach that allows some LPs to trade their extra runoff retention capacities with LPs that have building difficulties, so that they can jointly reach the overall mitigation goal together. The rationale behind CT is that, to avoid potential penalties, it may be more economical for some LPs to \\'buy\\' credit rather than to \\'build\\' GIs. A case study was used to demonstrate CT operations for two trading scales: (1) CT within neighboring LPs (i.e., CT-1), and (2) CT within 20 m-radius LPs (i.e., CT-2). A GI implementation baseline intensity was set up firstly by treating the whole study area as one entity to reach a specified stormwater runoff control target; individual LPs were then examined for their GI building capacities, which may be deficit or surplus against the target. Results showed that the number and area of deficit LPs were reduced significantly through either CT scales; the number of deficit LPs was reduced from 139 to 97 with CT-1 and 78 with CT-2, and the deficit area was reduced from 649 ha to 558 with CT-1 and 478 ha with CT-2, respectively. The proposed method assumes LPs as the basic planning unit and encourages some stakeholders to maximize their GI building potential to compensate for those with disadvantages. The economic incentives for conducting CT among different LPs in urban area can help achieve stormwater mitigation goals more economically and flexibly. Some coordination among LPs in GI implementation is necessary, which presents both opportunities and challenges for city management. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 by the authors.\"\\n\"Wang G., Zhang Q., Li Y., Mclellan B.C., Pan X.\",\"Corrective regulations on renewable energy certificates trading: Pursuing an equity-efficiency trade-off\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063112062&doi=10.1016%2fj.eneco.2019.03.008&partnerID=40&md5=5c81d3ba382a2f188c4c3b93d355c6da\",\"As a common policy tool for reducing the cost of achieving the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) targets, Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) trade can also exacerbate distributional inequity in provincial renewable electricity consumption.

The energy, economic, and equity impacts of these corrective regulations were analyzed by applying a multi-region multi-market equilibrium model to China as a case study.

Compared to the electricity price premium for renewable energy and voluntary green certificate prices, the social cost of implementing these corrective regulations are within the public\\'s willingness-to-pay. Moreover, the cost curve of increasing equity using the two corrective regulations on REC trade were obtained.

However, few detailed studies have investigated whether a green rating leads to higher occupant satisfaction with indoor environmental quality (IEQ). This research builds on previous work to address this. Based on the analysis of a subset of the Center for the Built Environment Occupant Indoor Environmental Quality survey database featuring 11,243 responses from 93 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-rated office buildings, this study explores the relationships between the points earned in the IEQ category and the satisfaction expressed by occupants with the qualities of their indoor environment. It was found that the achievement of a specific IEQ credit did not substantively increase satisfaction with the corresponding IEQ factor, while the rating level, and the product and version under which certification had been awarded, did not affect workplace satisfaction. There could be several reasons for this, some of which are outside the control of designers and beyond the scope of rating systems based primarily on design intent. The challenges and priorities facing building professionals, researchers and green building certification systems are discussed for the creation of more comfortable, higher performing and healthier green-rated buildings. \\xc2\\xa9 2017, \\xc2\\xa9 2017 The Author(s).

Considerable resources are devoted to fire protection including equipment, staff, training, and the facilities to house them. Fire stations, in particular, have a significant cost impact on state and municipal budgets. Fire stations are required in most local governments and like other municipal buildings are central to identity. To limit the cost of operating a fire station, municipalities have looked to more green building options. Green-rating systems such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) system have been used in the U.S. to assess green buildings. Thus, this paper aims to analyze 95 certified fire stations under the LEED-NC 2009 version (v3) that are located in the United States. A scorecard analysis (credits and points) of public data available serve as the foundation to describe the status of the green design and construction of these fire stations. The findings indicate that the points in the Material Resources (MR) category are achieved at the lowest rate compared to the other categories, on average 38% of 14 available points were earned. In addition, the points in the Energy and Atmosphere (EA) category are one of the lowest achievement rates, equal to 40.2%. The data also shows that 82% of LEED-certified fire stations belong to career or mostly career type, which are municipality fire departments funded by local governments. The significance of this study is to demonstrate the importance of both MR and EA categories for the design and construction phases of green fire stations. \\xc2\\xa9 2019, College Publishing.

As the main target for banks to issue green credit, environmental protection companies carry out research and development (R&D) activities for the purposes of protecting the environment and sustainable development. Therefore, the R&D level of environmental protection companies is a measure of whether the green credit policy meets its purpose. Therefore, it is particularly important to study green credit from a company perspective. This paper used panel data from 24 environmental protection companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchange from 2012 to 2017 and adopted a threshold model to examine the relationship between green credit and company R&D level. The results indicate that there is a positive but nonlinear relationship between green credit and company R&D levels. The empirical analysis through the threshold model shows that a threshold effect remains on the relationship and this threshold effect is caused by the levels of firm size, bank lending, and government subsidies. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 by the authors.\"\\n\"Vaisi S., Kharvari F.\",\"Evaluation of Daylight regulations in buildings using daylight factor analysis method by radiance\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062289538&doi=10.1016%2fj.esd.2019.02.002&partnerID=40&md5=2ec62992a0371e08eff2db899f38e7ad\",\"Daylighting plays a key role in occupants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thermal and visual comfort as well as developing a sustainable environment.

The Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) has recently been introduced to this area as an internationally recognized third-party Green building rating system (GBRS). The study has adopted a dual-tier cross-comparative approach to answer two research questions (Q); on one hand, setting the LEED system as a common base recognized the variations of countries\\' adoption patterns of LEED certification and pinpoints the associated challenges (Q1). On the other hand, countries of similar development backgrounds but variations in their economic, environmental, legislative and judicial conditions indicate the factors determining the diffusion of the LEED system in the area (Q2). In this regard, the analysis has highlighted two sets of governing parameters; a) LEED diffusion associated parameters and b) countries\\' associated parameters. Accordingly, a quantitative methodology has been applied to investigate both sets, on the regional level including seventeen countries and this is narrowed down to a detailed level for principal LEED adopting countries. To answer Q1, it has been found that the diffusion of green buildings is slowly taking place on a steady rate but it is more pronounced as a trajectory form for new construction buildings and standalone high-income housing projects but is it alarming to note the minor share of the existing building stock. Nevertheless, the adoption rates of different categories vary to reflect the regional potentials and challenges of applying green design and construction measures; they are highest for the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Innovation in Design\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98Regional Priority\\xe2\\x80\\x99 followed by the \\'sustainable Sites\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98Water Efficiency\\xe2\\x80\\x99, less for the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Energy and Atmosphere\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98Indoor Environmental Quality\\xe2\\x80\\x99 categories and least for the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Materials and Resources\\xe2\\x80\\x99 category. Moreover, the total average adoption rate of the five principal categories, as well as the prevailing type of LEED, version and certification level, correspond with the international status. To answer Q2, the previously defined parameters are put for statistical analysis. Significant inter-correlations have indicated that the rate of adoption of categories is strongly influenced by the number of LEED certified projects, accredited professionals and member organisations in one country. Furthermore, significant intra-correlations have associated countries\\' average adoption rates of categories with their economic parameters (gross domestic product and gross national income) as well as their emissions\\' release and energy use. This points out that the main push-factors for the diffusion of the LEED system in the MENA region are the economic vantage of hosting countries, in addition to the presence of a robust legislative framework within strategic national objectives. This contribution enables deducting the main factors that may help endorse or else hinder third-party green building certification in developing countries and pinpoint the importance of adopting a comprehensive approach to promote sustainable buildings which shall serve as the basis for successive research work. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Ismaeel W.S.E.\",\"Drawing the operating mechanisms of green building rating systems\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059549895&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2018.12.115&partnerID=40&md5=7be8e1fd095a4fd4b4e294a00b3f8049\",\"Green Building Rating and Certification systems (GBRSs) were developed to provide guidelines and benchmarking criteria for conducting sustainable building processes.

The research has adopted an integrated qualitative and quantitative approach where the development of the four interrelated scopes of operation has been traced through literature, and an assigned score weighting has been used to compare them according to different GBRSs- and more specifically for the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) credits.

The result provides a consistent mean to manage and document building activities and finally report buildings\\' performance. This shall prove very useful for researchers, practitioners and system developers.

Nonetheless, the need for economic development accompanied by high industrialisation and commercialisation strategies has generated natural environmental effects which have raised enormous concern to green interest groups about whether all the seventeen sustainable development goals will be achieved. This paper investigated the environmental effects of financial development in OECD countries from 2001 to 2012 by employing static models and system GMM analysis. The study utilised foreign direct investments, domestic credit to private sector by banks and domestic credit to private sector as the three proxies of financial development. The effects of these measures of financial development were examined on carbon emissions and greenhouse gases (indicators of environmental quality) and environmental sustainability. In this setting, the findings of the research spotlight that domestic credit to private sector by banks shows a negative and significant relationship with carbon emissions, greenhouse gases and sustainability. Conversely, domestic credit to private sector and economic growth indicates a positive and statistically significant relationship with carbon emissions, greenhouse gases and sustainability. Foreign direct investment is positive and significantly connected with carbon emissions and sustainability but only shows a positive and not significant link with greenhouse gases. The evidence suggested by this analysis adds that the financial system should continue to add more initiatives which consider natural environmental perspectives in their current operations. This present study also confirms the existence of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) in carbon emissions (turning point, $109,820), total greenhouse gases (turning point, $74,280) and sustainability (turning point, $112,505). The finding that the turning point of carbon emissions is higher than that of total greenhouse gases indicates why introducing initiatives designed to curb growth of carbon emissions in the respective OECD economies is important. \\xc2\\xa9 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\"\\n\"Raberto M., Ozel B., Ponta L., Teglio A., Cincotti S.\",\"From financial instability to green finance: the role of banking and credit market regulation in the Eurace model\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044331576&doi=10.1007%2fs00191-018-0568-2&partnerID=40&md5=9c8f503cf8bf2a3dea655f394acd603d\",\"We investigate appropriate banking and regulatory policies aimed at pushing the banking sector to shift from speculative lending, the cause of asset bubbles and economic crises, to green investments lending, so as to foster the transition to a more energy efficient production technology. For this purpose, we consider an enriched version of the Eurace model, which includes heterogenous capital goods, allowing for different degrees of energy efficiency in the production technology. Credit money in Eurace is endogenous and limited by Basel capital adequacy regulation on the supply side, while on the demand side it is determined by firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 investments and households\\xe2\\x80\\x99 house purchasing. We introduce a differentiation of capital requirements according to the destination of lending, demanding higher bank capital in the case of speculative lending, thus encouraging banks to finance firm investment. As up-to-date capital goods have better energy efficiency in the model design, a higher pace of investment implies also a positive environmental effect. Results suggest that the proposed regulation is able to foster investments and capital accumulation in the short term, improving the energy efficiency of firms. However, reducing mortgages with a restrictive regulation has a negative impact on total private credit, and thus on endogenous money supply, weakening consumption and aggregate demand. In the long term, the contraction of total credit becomes stronger, and the negative outcomes on aggregate demand also affect investment. Therefore, in the long run, the positive effects on capital and energy efficiency become negligible, while the main economic indicators deteriorate. \\xc2\\xa9 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\"\\n\"Mettanant V., Katejanekarn T., Chantrasawang T., Ounwised M.\",\"The financially optimum level for a green office building: LEED v4 vs LEED 2009\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077958754&doi=10.1109%2fiEECON45304.2019.8938913&partnerID=40&md5=c38a344a7b1268d481e5bae25a0211a4\",\"The concern of environmental and energy issues has been highly increased. The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification is updated from LEED 2009 to LEED v.4 with stronger demand on energy, material, and water performances of buildings. These affects the building construction cost for getting the green building levels, namely certified, silver, gold and platinum. Investing at the financially optimum level is the most significant issue for the enterprises aiming for LEED certification. A comparison of the building construction cost to attain credits between LEED 2009 and LEED v.4 are studied. A 5-storey office building with an area of 958.92 m2 is selected as a case study. In the analysis, the similar measures were used for both LEED versions. The priority for selecting the measures ranging from the measures that do not require investment but provide saving to the measures that require investment but no saving in return. The results show that when applying both versions of LEED, the gold level provides the shortest payback period. However, the highest internal rates of return occur at different level. For LEED 2009, the certified level shows the highest internal rate of return at 10.07%. The platinum level provides the highest internal rate of return at 8.32%, when applying the measures according to LEED v.4.

The fundamental way to prevent global warming is by reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Achieving this has become a key concern for all countries. The logarithmic mean divisia index model was constructed to decompose the total carbon emission increment. Carbon finance effect was divided into green credit effect and carbon trading effect to analyze the impact of carbon finance on carbon emissions. The results showed that the total carbon emission reduction value caused by green credit effect from 2010 to 2016 in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region was 66193.96 million tons, and the added value of carbon emission caused by carbon trading effect was 80266.68 million tons. There are regional differences in the effects of carbon finance on carbon emissions in these regions. It can be concluded that to a certain extent, green credit can reduce carbon emissions, and carbon trading can increase carbon emissions. Using the gradual expansion of carbon finance trading and market mechanism of carbon finance to solve the problem of carbon emission can improve the efficiency of carbon emission reduction. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 by the authors.\"\\n\"Howells R.J., Burthe S.J., Green J.A., Harris M.P., Newell M.A., Butler A., Wanless S., Daunt F.\",\"Correction to: Pronounced long-term trends in year-round diet composition of the European shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis (Marine Biology, (2018), 165, 12, (188), 10.1007/s00227-018-3433-9)\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062041648&doi=10.1007%2fs00227-019-3479-3&partnerID=40&md5=de32bf9b685d7ea7480940060ddae74e\",\"The article Pronounced long-term trends in year-round diet composition of the European shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis, written by Richard J.

Due to environmental worry, the acceptability of green products into today\\'s competitive market is on the rise. Therefore, this study focuses on the determination of the green degree of a finished product in an imperfect production system, where production cost depends on the green degree of the produced product. This research, for the first time, looks into the optimum number of business cycles and raw-materials replenishment cycle in an integrated production inventory model in green supply chain with two-level credit period. The supply chain consists of a raw-materials supplier, a manufacturer and a retailer, where the supplier offers a quantity dependent credit period to the manufacturer and the retailer is also facilitated with a credit period by the manufacturer. In this paper, retailer\\'s credit period has been considered in type-2 fuzzy nature. Here, the manufacturer produces green products in an imperfect production system where the rate of perfectness of a product depends on production rate and time.

In this pathway, maintaining resource adequacy in the context of increased intermittency in generation has become a major concern. This paper examines this requirement to maintain resource adequacy and compare the costs and carbon impacts for new gas turbines or biomass conversions to achieve this in an expedient transitional way. This is formulated as a policy optimization in which the imperative is to replace existing coal with a renewable alternative (in this case study, wind) and to maintain the system security at the existing level, and thereby find the optimal subsidies, either as energy credits (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreen certificates\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontracts-for-differences\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) or capital benefits (\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccapacity payments\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or tax allowances). In a model of the GB system, the results show that biomass-conversion outperforms investment in peaking gas turbines to deal with the transitional economic externality of extra reserve costs. In particular, the results suggest benefits of 10% lower costs of subsidies, 70% lower implied costs of carbon, and a reduction of 18% in wholesale power prices. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Yin W., Kirkulak-Uludag B., Zhang S.\",\"Is financial development in China green?

Based on a difference-in-differences (DID) model, the results show that, since the promulgation of the Green Credit Guidelines policy, financial institutions have significantly reduced the proportion of long-term debt to heavily polluting enterprises for reasons such as risk aversion and total credit constraints. Due to capital constraints and the restrictive terms of credit approval, the Green Credit Guidelines policy reduces the investment scale and overinvestment of heavily polluting enterprises. The dependency relationship of the debt maturity structure of heavily polluting enterprises with the investment scale and investment efficiency has been reduced. Furthermore, the negative net effect of the Green Credit Guidelines policy on long-term debt is more pronounced in heavily polluting enterprises that lack political connections. However, the promulgation of this policy inhibits the investment scale and the investment efficiency of heavily polluting enterprises (with or without political connections).

The analysis of the current research has shown insufficient development of the idea of the green loan. It is only the theoretical aspect of its influence on the bank activities that has been defined, not its practical effect. The authors studied the green loan impact on the results of the bank activities on the example of overdue loans. For the analysis, they used the panel data of 10 out of 24 largest banks in China in 2012-2017. The evaluation is based on a random effects model. The calculations have been done by means of the generalized least-squares method in MSEXCEL. It has been revealed that green loans in the loan portfolio of the bank contribute to the overdue loans decrease. It has been determined that the main factors influencing the decision making by the borrower and the lender are reputation, public, equity and regulatory pressure, alternative capital pools, credit profiles, availability, capital requirements. However, there is no standard credit documentation for the green loan today. To make this financial tool efficient and sound, it is necessary to further develop regulations, to change approaches to disclosing information on sustainability issues in the non-financial part of annual reporting.

A validated interview schedule was used to elicit information on the youths\\xe2\\x80\\x99 awareness of and involvement in a set of pro-green economy agronomic practices that generate environmental amenities and increase economic growth via increased yield. Research findings showed that the average income of the respondents was US$1097 (~NGN397, 931.56) per annum. The average farm size was 6.1 acres. The respondents were more aware of and involved in mulching relative to other nine agronomic practices identified in the study. Whereas culture was indicated as an insignificant constraint to the youths\\xe2\\x80\\x99 involvement, unavailability of credit facilities, lack of market opportunity, scarcity of information on the agronomic practices, and limited access to extension services were ranked as the major constraints. The chapter concluded that the improvement in the content and sources of communication and provision of input-supports through government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ecological program for the farm youths would perhaps increase the youths\\xe2\\x80\\x99 involvement in the enhancement of an agriculture-supported green economy. \\xc2\\xa9 2020 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

However, most articles in this area address the use of blockchain in the private trading of cryptocurrencies. This paper is a case study on a pioneer blockchain application in the management of the Green Treasure Program, which operates through an online platform for negotiating Forest Credits, a title issued from environmental services. The context of this analysis is the management of the Green Treasure in the State of Amap\\xc3\\xa1, the Amazon region of Brazil, which has a complex and interesting reality for research: on the one hand, this region faces difficulties in attracting resources due to its socioeconomic isolation; in contrast, more than 90% of its territory is totally preserved. The purpose of this study is to discover the different objectives that can come from the perception of value, among the public and the private sector, during environmental services negotiation on a blockchain based platform. For this, we conduct qualitative research on the case study using the theory of public value and an interpretative perspective, seeking the understanding of the different objectives among the actors involved. The main contribution is to present the use of blockchain in government projects that promote sustainability, the main research gap identified. The results suggest that blockchain can provide security, transparency, and traceability in operations, critical factors for the government, and especially for attracting investors with different profiles. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 Association for Information Systems.

The impact of not recovering such valuable elements is that new raw materials need to be extracted from the crust. Hence, the demand for primary resources is increasing exponentially and the depletion of mines is putting at risk the very development of green and efficient technologies which heavily rely on such materials. Consequently, it becomes very important that WEEEs (waste electric and electronic equipment) become appropriately recycled. In this paper a thermodynamic assessment related to the material composition from different devices has been carried out to provide a physical value for each device. This has been done through an indicator called thermodynamic rarity, which rates minerals according to their scarcity in the crust and the energy required to mine and refine them. The scarcer the mineral and the more energy intensive the process to extract and refine a mineral, the greater the thermodynamic rarity of the raw material. Based on this, an expression has been developed to value WEEE that are sent to an appropriate recycling plant through the so-called ecocredits. This expression is based on the raw material content of the given device, assessed through the thermodynamic rarity indicator, the state of the device (i.e. if it is suitable for reuse) and the lifetime (to avoid encouraging the throw-away culture). Ecocredits are then granted to users at the moment when they dispose of appropriately the WEEEs through a mobile phone application. The ecocredits can then be exchanged in the form of different incentive schemes. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.All rights reserved.\"\\n\"Cohen J.M.\",\"Green Reuolution in Ethiopia: The Politics of Rural Deuelopment in a Blocked and Inequitable Society\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082252994&doi=10.4324%2f9780429047770-4&partnerID=40&md5=544b66edbfd09221d1c0588703727a02\",\"This chapter considers the geography, ecology, climate, resources, population characteristics, settlement patterns, town environments, transport and infrastructure patterns, and other dimensions of the rural environment in which the Ethiopian society and Chilalo social system.

Objectives formulated as to find the relationship of Producer\\'s variables with agricultural supply chain variables, to understand the effect of Producer\\'s variables with agricultural supply chain variables and to get the econometric model as the solution for the proposed conceptual model. Cluster sampling method of probability sampling was used to select the respondent from a cluster of green agricultural growers. The sample size for the farmer was 757.

Constraints in the specific case of producers is conceptually not accepted based on the responses of farmers. The current research has the novelty of applying econometric assessment model for the agricultural supply chain which can be a common technique for the applicability in agribusiness. Although many research have suggested conceptually uses of econometric model but variables and dimensions considered here are innovative at its level.

Our results show a positive impact of EI and R&D&I tax credit on employment for MSMEs and SMEs. The impact is stronger for R&D&I tax credit than for EI tax credit and stronger for MSMEs than for SMEs. Also, the impacts of both tax credits are independent of each other. We help to provide insights into the impacts of two types of tax credits on employment level for micro and SMEs that are the backbone of an economy.

Some planners deemed environmental degradation a necessary evil in order to fulfill pledges of development, progress, and better living standard. However, from the 1970s onwards environmental issues were addressed in urban planning, improvement of central-heating systems, by setting out emission thresholds, and mandatory environment clearance for credits approval for corporative entities, but law enforcement was not upheld to the highest standards and in full. The League of Communists of Slovenia allowed rather loosely knitted grass-roots environmental enthusiasts since the late 1960s; groups were comprised with well-educated citizens, which were mostly keen mountaineers. Environmentalists were especially active in urban areas mostly dealing with local issues (urban planning, sewage systems, contamination of the tap water, and excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers). In 1971, local environmental societies merged into the Association for Environmental Protection in Slovenia (AEPS), which in the late 1970s focused broadened scope of activities, mainly against the construction of hydroelectric power installations on the So\\xc4\\x8da River and the Mura River, and the Nuclear Power Plant Kr\\xc5\\xa1ko after the Chernobyl accident. In the 1970s, in Yugoslavia and Slovenia as well, concurrently with the West, modern legislation for environmental protection was adopted, and new self-government bodies for environmental issues comprising with politicians, lawyers, scientists, and environmentalists were established; thus the influence of AEPS somehow diminished.The Slovenian government increased finances for research, and at the same time in the environmental debates replaced politicians with technocrats, who proved to be unwilling listeners to environmentalists\\' complaints and suggestions. The environmentalists were accused by a top-level politician of being exaggerators, followers of Western initiatives and in general obstructers of development. In 1980s environmentalists broadened its ranks and scope of activities, especially after the Chernobyl Nuclear Accident. Environmental societies and society were attracting people who were interested in changes but did not want to risk direct political opposition and the consequences of this type of direct dissent. Slovenian environmental groups played an important role during the democratization. In 1989 they even established a political party \\'Zeleni Slovenije\\' (Greens of Slovenia). The party was a partner in the first post-communist Slovenian government (1990-1992), and they successfully pushed for incorporation of \\'green policies\\' in the Slovenian legislation. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 Hrvatski Institut za Povijest.

Berseem clover (BC; Trifolium alexandrinum) and chickling vetch (CV; Lathyrus sativus L.) are two legumes that could be beneficial when spring-seeded, but they have not been well studied in this context. The objectives of this study were to measure spring-seeded cover crop biomass and N yield, and the subsequent effects on sweet corn yield and response to N fertilizer. The study was conducted in 2014 and 2015, and the experimental design was a randomized complete block split-plot design with cover crop as whole-plot treatments [CV, BC, berseem clover and oat (Avena sativa) mixture (BC + O), oats, and no cover crop] and N rate as split-plot treatments. Cover crop growth and effects on sweet corn production varied greatly between years, with both cover crop and sweet corn biomass greater in 2015, although BC produced very little biomass (&lt;0.7 Mg ha-1) and thus is not recommended for spring seeding. In 2014, CV resulted in the lowest agronomically optimum N rates (AONRs) compared with no cover crop, suggesting a potential N credit when only having an N yield of 11.6 kg ha-1, but this effect was not seen in 2015. There was also no evidence that oat would supply N to the subsequent crop. Overall, evidence is lacking that any spring-seeded cover crop will provide a consistent N benefit on sandy soil, and limitations to spring growth may preclude widespread adoption. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 American Society for Horticultural Science.

Since 2010, the states in the bay watershed have been developing and implementing actions, primarily via regulated communities. Recent outreach has focused on encouraging non-regulated communities to take voluntary actions. However, without regulations or funding, those communities are limited in their ability to contribute. The Healthy Watersheds project focuses on the recognizing the value of forest cover for achieving Chesapeake Bay water quality goals. A key to successful land conservation is to create, or tap into, a market for the private financing of high quality forest and agricultural land retention and land reforestation. By aggregating a landowner\\'s potential ecosystem service offerings (e.g., carbon credits, water quality credits, habitat enhancement, etc.), and matching those environmental resources to the investment market\\'s structural protocols (e.g., trade regulations, trade restrictions, liquidity, tax treatment, secondary markets, etc.), a financial conduit can be developed to link the aggregated demand for those green resources with money for the land owners and host locality. This approach essentially pays landowners to maintain or expand forest land which, in turn, improves water quality in the bay watershed and the bay itself allowing non-regulated communities to contribute to meeting the regional goals. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.\"\\n\"Pasquel F., Smedley S.\",\"An innovative approach to implement stormwater utilities and incorporate a credit system that enhances stakeholder buy-in\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075027688&partnerID=40&md5=a234b6ec90374e657bad7c4630cb82b6\",\"As the regulatory requirements for stormwater management continue to put financial pressure on municipal governments, more and more communities are identifying dedicated funding sources to meet MS4 stormwater permit requirements and fund capital and maintenance needs.

For the empirical analysis, pooled ordinary least squares (OLS), fixed effects model, random effects model, Driscoll-Kraay (DK) standard errors, and system generalized method of moments (GMM) are employed. The findings reveal that all indicators of financial development namely domestic credit to private sector, domestic credit to private sector by banks, and domestic credit provided by financial sector significantly help to improve the environmental quality by reducing the ecological footprint. Comparatively, the effect of domestic credit to private sector is stronger than other measures of financial development. Similarly, urbanization has been accompanied by the significant reduction in ecological footprint. In contrast, energy consumption, foreign direct investment (FDI), and GDP per capita worsen the environmental quality by increasing the ecological footprint. The study also validates the existence of \"\"pollution haven hypothesis\"\" for the global economy. Findings of the study have global implications. In general, financial sector has the potential to support the global efforts towards environmental protection. However, regional or country specific experiences can differ depending upon the financial sector priority towards environmental protection. \\xc2\\xa9 2019.\"\\n\"Susan, Wardhani D.K.\",\"Enhancing indoor health comfort in adaptively reused heritage building\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069231209&doi=10.5176%2f2301-394X_ACE19.512&partnerID=40&md5=2ab414fb9b636fb00d19eb00990d9ba8\",\"A heritage building that being adaptively reused has some concerns regarding indoor health and comfort. They are prone to cause discomfort to the occupants. The assessment based on GBCI rating tools of Indoor Health and Comfort gives the existing building (Perpustakaan Bank Indonesia) 10 credits. 1 credit for outdoor air introduction, 6 credits for chemical pollutant, 1 credit for outside view, and 1 credit for thermal comfort. This research aims to propose proper strategies, to make the building has better condition of indoor health and comfort, which represent by higher credits from GBCI rating tools. Strategies are observed, simulated, and manually calculated to enhance indoor health and comfort, as well as giving the building more credits. No-smoking campaign should be applied as prequisite criteria of indoor health and comfort. CO2 sensors are placed in computer room and kids reading area, which gives the building additional 1 credit. Maintenance and treatment for ducting system are proposed to give the building 1 more credit. Other 2 credits come from the planning of artificial lighting and individual switching system. 78% transmittance glass is proposed to enhance illuminance level, which leads the building to get another 1 credit. Standing AC unit gives higher control to the occupants in every different rooms, and this strategy gives the building another 1 credit. Treatment for noise level using green wall fence gives the building 1 credit. Interior plants (2 credits) and pest management (1 credit) are the last two strategies proposed to enhance indoor health and comfort. Those strategies give the building another 10 credits, which lead them to achieve 19 credits from 28 total credits available in the rating tools. \\xc2\\xa9 GSTF 2019.\"\\n\"Jeon E.-D., Lee K.-U., Lee C.-K.\",\"Development of a new clean development mechanism methodology for the quantification of greenhouse gas in calcium sulfoaluminate cement\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068666104&doi=10.3390%2fsu10021482&partnerID=40&md5=759f5c581706f36fb699a5fb662c4cd5\",\"The purpose of this research was to probe beyond the scope of the \"\"National Strategy Project on Carbon Mineralization\"\" to develop a \"\"United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Clean Development Mechanism\"\" (UNFCCC CDM) methodology that enables reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) by \"\"green cement\"\" under the calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement technologies. The findings will be utilized as the foundations and developed into the UNFCCC CDM project. There were two existing methodologies related to cement, but neither was applicable for CSA cement. The existing methodologies are applicable only when there is one clinker, but CSA cement utilizes more than one clinker. Through this research, we developed methodologies to use waste-based material for avoiding emission leakage and utilized more than one clinker to calculate GHG emissions and reduction. For this purpose, we utilized the CSA cement methodology for calculating GHG reduction compared to Portland cement and found that CSA cement allowed for a reduction of 0.281 tCO2-eq/ton above the reduction enabled by Portland cement. We are presently preparing to register the CSA cement methodology for UNFCCC CDM methodology approval. With the technology transfer and support for this CSA cement technology and methodology, developing countries will be able to achieve their national GHG reduction targets and gain carbon credits. Thus, CSA cement technology could serve as an important tool to deal with GHG emissions and climate change. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 by the authors.\"\\n\"Khabarov N., Lubowski R., Krasovskii A., Obersteiner M.\",\"Flobsion\\xe2\\x80\\x94flexible option with benefit sharing\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067581651&doi=10.3390%2fijfs7020022&partnerID=40&md5=a7a18bbca210772ad46527b260da6263\",\"Global environmental goals and the Paris agreement declared the need to avoid dangerous climate change by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases with an ultimate goal to transform today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s policies and reach climate neutrality before the end of the century.

In this context, there is a need for tools to buffer CO2 prices within the period of transition to greener technologies when the emission offsetting markets expose high volatility. Contracts for optional future purchase of carbon credits could provide emitters with a cost-efficient solution to address existing regulatory risks. At the same time, this would help to create much needed financing for the projects generating carbon credits in the future.

In the case of Bang Kachao, Green Space has been improved by the development of gardens in the city. The objective of this study focused on an evaluation of the benefits of big trees in the urban area at Bang Kachao Green Space, Samutprakan province. Data was collected from six types of tree habitat classified as road side, abandoned area, public area, private area, temple area, and park located across six sub districts of Bang Kachao. Data were analyzed to evaluate the monetary value of big trees from direct and indirect benefits in three parts consisting of timber value, carbon credits value, and spiritual value. The results reveal that the most valuable big trees are in the parks, followed by temple area, road side, private area, abandoned area, and public area respectively. The total monetary value of big trees was 23,447 USD of which timber value was 13,844 USD, carbon credits value was 7,309 USD, and spiritual value was 2,294 USD. The evaluation suggests that management of high value big trees in park, temple, and road side areas is important from a stakeholder perspective.

Although the traditional building styles are followed, due to the small size opening window, the indoor environment is not so good. It does not have enough sunlight and weak airflow; so there should be some particular changes of the design characteristics to enhance air movement and to provide enough sunlight. Consequently, this paper is to study the existing traditional houses in Cambodia through the investigation and the energy consumption in the houses is analyzed using the principle of passive house design. Improvements in energy saving of residential traditional houses detailing were put forward. Furthermore, the economic advantage of the proposed measurements was validated by comparison between the proposed passive house and traditional house through the analysis using simulation software. Therefore, an analysis through the simulation software, Design Builder, and case studies are used for the study on lighting and energy consumption on cooling load. According to the simulation result, the proposed house with bigger area needs less energy consumption than the case study; moreover, the proposed house also has better sun-light than the case study according to the Green Star Credit IEQ4 Report after the simulation. As data collection through the Temperature Data Logger (TDL) in Cambodia is time-consuming, so the study is shortened to one month study which might be in-sufficient for a whole year result. Moreover, since the available time of the study is in rainy season, future research should study dry season.

In this paper, factor analysis, entropy methods, and dynamic evaluation models are used to obtain the ranking of competitiveness. In addition, according to the same steps as above, the comprehensive ranking based on the CAMELS evaluation system (A comprehensive rating system which is standardized, institutionalized and indexed for business operations of commercial banks and other financial institutions.) was obtained.

It is found that with the entropy weight method, in the G-CAMELS system, the weight of the green index is quite large, so it magnifies the impact of the financial industry on the environment. Compared with the original CAMELS system, the newly formed system will increase the ranking of state-owned banks and there is no significant change in the ranking of joint-stock banks. In order to improve the competitiveness of banks, state-owned banks should innovate their banking business and continue to implement the green credit policy; joint-stock banks should continue to seize the opportunity of green credit and expand profitability while paying attention to safety.

The paradigm shift from conventional to green buildings is expected to yield environmental, social, and economic benefits. However, green building implementation is adversely affected by initial cost premiums. Therefore, there is a clear need to analyse the initial stages of green building development regarding life-cycle impacts, considering massive savings in energy, water, and other resources. Although it may be cheaper to select inappropriate technologies during the initial decision-making stages, more importantly, this may preclude life-cycle savings and the desired outcomes of green buildings. In order to aid the initial decision-makers with the selection of credit points considering the life-cycle costs of green buildings, this research develops a life-cycle cost model that incorporates developer constraints while maximising the number of credit points achieved when using the Green Star Australia environmental rating system. The model identified green building credits with cost savings such as the use of photovoltaic panels, which are ignored during the initial stages owing to high initial costs. Certain inter-dependent credits with lower life-cycle costs have not yet been considered in green building implementation. \\xc2\\xa9 Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.\"\\n\"Polydoropoulou A., Pagoni I., Tsirimpa A., Tsouros I.\",\"Modelling travelers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 behavior in the presence of reward schemes offered for green multimodal choices\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058999200&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-02305-8_43&partnerID=40&md5=19ce8007d981ddbc0a5cdc4b24fc0730\",\"This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of reward-based schemes on altering traveler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision making towards sustainable multimodal transportation.

To probe this problem, it is necessary to explore how value is created and distributed in the green economy, and how the production processes of new green commodities like carbon credits shape the social and material realities from which they emerge. In this article, we examine how voluntary carbon credits are produced and acquire value through the implementation of REDD+ in voluntary markets, which essentially entails the demonstration of project compliance with a set of techno-bureaucratic standards or rules, known as validation and verification. Through participant observation of these processes at a REDD+ project site in Cambodia, we reveal how the REDD+ standards give rise to bureaucratic performance and disciplined adherence to an \\xe2\\x80\\x9caudit culture\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that is both apolitical and indifferent to local realities. The local realities observed in Cambodia entailed profound environmental and social injustices, especially for indigenous communities facing illegal logging and land alienation. While the REDD+ initiative initially engaged these communities in Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) and indigenous communal land titling, the techno-bureaucratic exigencies of the REDD+ standards ultimately curtailed such formal possibilities for local rights and agency. We call this phenomenon bureaucratic violence, as it involves the implementation of mundane technical rules that hide local contestation, sideline criticism and deny justice. Furthermore, we argue that bureaucratic violence is fundamental to the generation of value in the green economy, as a process that works alongside commodification, spectacle, and other forms of structural and material violence. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Monasterolo I., Raberto M.\",\"The impact of phasing out fossil fuel subsidies on the low-carbon transition\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056157251&doi=10.1016%2fj.enpol.2018.08.051&partnerID=40&md5=5a0c675026ee2769b3d372467d16c64c\",\"There is growing consensus on the fact that fossil fuel subsidies provided by governments in high-income countries represent a misalignment on emissions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 reduction with the global climate agenda. In addition, a discussion emerged on the negative socio-economic and environmental externalities associated with fossil fuel subsidies. Nevertheless, pathways for phasing out fossil fuel subsidies in high income countries and their implications on the low-carbon transition have not yet been assessed. With the aim to narrow this knowledge gap, we extend the EIRIN Stock-Flow Consistent behavioral model to study the implications on sustainable development of the gradual phasing out of fossil fuels subsidies, whose revenues could be used by the government to subsidize energy investments in green capital (e.g. solar panels), either via fiscal policies or green bonds. We assess the effects on green growth, employment, credit and bonds market, as well as the distributive effects across heterogeneous households and sectors. A smooth phasing out of fossil fuels subsidies contributes to improve macroeconomic performance, to decrease inequality and helps the government to find fiscal space to support stable renewable energy policies. Renewable energy subsidies contribute to foster the low-carbon transition but could imply distributive effects, depending on the way in which they are implemented. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n[No author name available],\"8th International Conference on Green Intelligent Transportation Systems and Safety, 2017\",2019,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054502677&partnerID=40&md5=efa4b41ee9feb9b65b95f55060d1a464\",\"The proceedings contain 85 papers.

They focus on projects, and rate levels of their performance compliance with specific goals and requirements, considering the building\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life-cycle: from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. While the certification methods vary across different rating tools, their common objective is that certified projects within these programs are conceived and designed to reduce the overall impact of the built environment both on the natural environment and, in theory, on the human health. Recent studies, based on a worldwide comparison of the main sustainable buildings rating tools, showed that human-related factors among assessment credits expressed in implicit and explicit terms, are limited and underweighted. Starting from these premises, the study is aimed to analyzing green buildings protocols applications by a human factor perspective. A review of 14 green high level certified realized buildings is presented, from an architectonic perspective, for understanding which explicit and implicit human-related points have been applied and how they have been translated in design features. \\xc2\\xa9 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\"\\n\"Mourtada A., Mourtada R., Eid S.\",\"Development of Practical Guidelines and Tools for GRASS green buildings rating system\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061547233&doi=10.1109%2fREDEC.2018.8597591&partnerID=40&md5=fc05ff5cffb1bafc73ddf92c91f7e3e6\",\"Lebanon introduced in 2012 GRASS (Green Recovery and Sustainable Solutions) a building rating system that suites Lebanon\\'s and Southern Mediterranean countries climate, style of living, and available resources.

However, granting credit also inevitably negatively impacts the capital opportunity cost and default risk, especially when customers are privileged with private information concerning their own credit status. Hence, the design of cash-credit payments is increasingly recognized as important in increasing the profitability of companies. Additionally, the supplier has three common mechanisms to address credit default problems: the screening, checking and insurance mechanisms. Under these three mechanisms, we develop a supplier-customer chain in which the customer\\'s credit level, which is either high or low, is the customer\\'s private information. We find that compared with symmetric information, the high-credit customer\\'s credit period and green consumption are restricted and limited, while the those of the low-credit customer are maintained in the screening mechanism, promoted in the checking mechanism and lessened in the insurance mechanism. We identify the conditions under which the supplier decides to choose each of the mechanisms. Finally, we show that if the market credit status is relatively poor, the supplier prefers to adopt only the screening mechanism. Otherwise, the supplier attains more leeway to decide whether to transfer risk via the insurance mechanism or to undertake risk via the screening and checking mechanisms based on the tension between the credit incentive effect and the default risk gap effect. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Tiwari S., Ahmed W., Sarkar B.\",\"Multi-item sustainable green production system under trade-credit and partial backordering\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053446611&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2018.08.181&partnerID=40&md5=794fa2dcc176f8ba5acf048327d0748d\",\"This study develops a green production quantity model with random imperfect quality items, trade-credit policy, service level constraints, and failure in reworking. In practice, not only the green production system but also the rework process is often imperfect. The presence of a single machine in the production system outcomes in limits for green production and partial backordering. It is assumed that the green production system may generate defective items, which are reworked. As a reworked process is also not perfect, it produces a random number of scrapped items. On the other hand, the supplier also offers a trade-credit policy to the buyer, which minimizes the on-hand stock and boosts sales. In fact, this model will help organizations to minimize their costs through cooperation in industry. The objective of this research is to find the optimal green production and backordered quantity of each item such that the projected total cost is minimized. The optimal solution for each scenario is derived and the application of the designed model is validated with two numerical examples. The results for both examples show that the minimum total cost for the green production system is achieved when the permissible delay-period given by the supplier to the buyer is greater than or equal to the aggregated sum of production uptime, reworking time, production downtime, and allowed shortage time. Sensitivity analysis of the proposed study is also done to illustrate the realistic usage. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Bataona D.S., Liantoni F., Laumal F.E., Wadu R.A., Manulangga G.C., Sudarmadji P.W., Ole K.A.T.\",\"Green computing on registration system and transaction report in Serviam credit union\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058323355&doi=10.1088%2f1757-899X%2f434%2f1%2f012250&partnerID=40&md5=ff23ee19c0ca976e9237b70e439692dc\",\"One of the cooperatives in Indonesia is Serviam Credit Union.

Many approaches have been proposed for high performance computing designing a task partitioning strategy able to assign pieces of execution to the appropriate workers in order to parallelize task execution. In this paper, we describe the CoremunitiTM system, our peer to peer solution for solving complex works by using the idling computational resources of users connected to our network. More in detail, we designed a framework that allows users to share their CPU and memory in a secure and efficient way. By doing this, users help each other by asking the network computational resources when they face high computing demanding tasks. In this respect, as users provide their computational power without providing specific human skill, our approach can be considered as a hybrid crowdsourcing. Differently from many proposals available for volunteer computing, users providing their resources are rewarded with tangible credits, i.e., they can redeem their credits by asking for computational power to solve their own task and/or by exchanging them for money. We conducted a comprehensive experimental assessment in an interesting scenario as 3D rendering, which allowed us to validate the scalability and effectiveness of our solution and its profitability for end-users. As we do not require to power additional resources for solving tasks (we better exploit unused resources already powered instead), we hypothesize a remarkable side effect at steady state: energy consumption reduction compared with traditional server farms or cloud based executions. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 Elsevier Inc.\"\\n\"Febi W., Sch\\xc3\\xa4fer D., Stephan A., Sun C.\",\"The impact of liquidity risk on the yield spread of green bonds\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043308391&doi=10.1016%2fj.frl.2018.02.025&partnerID=40&md5=b7c25bc01086a2e58d0662841afaad8b\",\"This study analyses how liquidity risk affects bonds\\xe2\\x80\\x99 yield spreads after controlling for credit risk, bond-specific characteristics and macroeconomic variables.

The emissions of methane from natural gas transportation pipeline are an important factor for global warming. While being transported by pipeline, natural gas is often emitted to the atmosphere, either for depressurization (venting emissions) or leak through the pipeline (fugitive emission). Emissions of methane are of particular concern since the methane represents the major component of natural gas and a powerful greenhouse gas. The present study investigates the feasibility of gas venting mitigation, from the Algerian natural gas transportation network with pipeline pump-down technique, prior pipeline maintenance activities. First, we calculate the amount of methane released during venting operation from GZ3 40\\xe2\\x80\\xb3 pipeline based on the weighted average pipe diameter and pressure in the pipeline section being repaired. We then estimate quantity of cost value of the gas recovered. We, thereafter, suggest a mobile compressor for saving this gas. The results obtained showed that using pump-down technique with portable compressor solution instead of venting mainly saves 54.873 million m3 of gas with gain net cost saving about 11.628 million USD. Avoiding the release of gas to the atmosphere during venting operations will be crucial to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. For the developing countries, including Algeria, mitigating these emissions can provide green investments for the joint implementation Kyoto Protocol flexibility mechanism. This will contribute to sustainable development and additional economic benefits through carbon credit revenues and technology transfer from industrialized countries. \\xc2\\xa9 The Author(s) 2018.\"\\n\"Baloch M.S., Saeed A., Ahmed I., Ol\\xc3\\xa1h J., Popp J., M\\xc3\\xa1t\\xc3\\xa9 D.\",\"Role of domestic financial reforms and internationalization of non-financial transnational firms: Evidence from the Chinese Market\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055576047&doi=10.3390%2fsu10113847&partnerID=40&md5=304a49baa0bcbc9db37122ea82577139\",\"The successful internationalization process of Chinese firms which enhances the sustainability of the Chinese economy receives massive research attention.

Using the financial data of non-financial firms for the period of 2005-2015, we demonstrate that the domestic financial reforms initiated the internationalization process that helps Chinese economies to achieve sustainable economic development. The study also finds that state-ownership helped firms to gain more from increased financial availability than the stand-alone firms.

The first IGFC demonstration plant with CCS may be in Japan in 2021 as a result of the CoolGen project. DCFC is still in its infancy and far from demonstration. The overall challenges for stationary fuel cells are cost and cell durability. Experience gained from research, designing, building and operating commercially available systems and the IGFC demonstration plant should lead to further development of the technologies and reduced costs, making them a realistic option for power generation. \\xc2\\xa9 The Author(s) 2018.

Based on this analysis, this study provides recommendations for policy diffusion: to integrate more constraints and incentives into low-carbon pilot sites; to establish a policy assessment system to identify effective local experiments; and to summarize and share these best practices across the country. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Dafermos Y., Nikolaidi M., Galanis G.\",\"Climate Change, Financial Stability and Monetary Policy\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048715815&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolecon.2018.05.011&partnerID=40&md5=03f6da0ab7c916ad2e2f7e888d08ddd3\",\"Using a stock-flow-fund ecological macroeconomic model, we analyse (i) the effects of climate change on financial stability and (ii) the financial and global warming implications of a green quantitative easing (QE) programme. Emphasis is placed on the impact of climate change damages on the price of financial assets and the financial position of firms and banks. The model is estimated and calibrated using global data and simulations are conducted for the period 2016\\xe2\\x80\\x932120. Four key results arise. First, by destroying the capital of firms and reducing their profitability, climate change is likely to gradually deteriorate the liquidity of firms, leading to a higher rate of default that could harm both the financial and the non-financial corporate sector. Second, climate change damages can lead to a portfolio reallocation that can cause a gradual decline in the price of corporate bonds. Third, climate-induced financial instability might adversely affect credit expansion, exacerbating the negative impact of climate change on economic activity. Fourth, the implementation of a green corporate QE programme can reduce climate-induced financial instability and restrict global warming. The effectiveness of this programme depends positively on the responsiveness of green investment to changes in bond yields. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 The Authors\"\\n\"Huang L., Fitzpatrick J.\",\"Lending a hand: perceptions of green credit cards\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052385407&doi=10.1108%2fIJBM-07-2017-0149&partnerID=40&md5=32f3ed87a76e9fb208d1e854dda58e21\",\"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of donation amount and framing on financial products, this research investigates consumers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 attitudes and behaviors toward cause-related credit cards with different donation sizes and framing types. Design/methodology/approach: This research investigates consumers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 perceptions of green credit cards using two experiments with a between-subject design (n =297) and a mixed design (n =238), respectively. All the participants, recruited from a major state university in the USA, are undergraduate students who use credit cards. Findings: A medium-size donation optimizes the outcome of a cause-related credit card offer. Moreover, a donation framed as cash rewards has stronger effects on a consumer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perception and consequent reactions to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d credit cards than an annual percentage rate framing. Finally, consumers with high levels of environmental concern and propensity to volunteer have stronger intention to adopt and are more likely to recommend the proposed credit card. Originality/value: Building upon the theories of social exchange and symbolic interaction, this research is the first to provide empirical evidence regarding the application of volunteerism and perceived consumer effectiveness for financial institutions and their cause-related marketing campaign partners in selecting suitable environmental causes. \\xc2\\xa9 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.\"\\n\"Brown L.A.\",\"Bad debt and green issues: Managing environmental risks in borrowers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 corporate insolvencies\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061832800&doi=10.1177%2f1461452918789873&partnerID=40&md5=5d0e8fcb01dda9efd65e25d8020ba562\",\"This article uses interview data, collected from \\xe2\\x80\\x98elite\\xe2\\x80\\x99 banking respondents, to examine how secured lenders use insolvency practitioners as a form of post-loan due diligence. It is concerned with how effective insolvency practitioners are at obviating the risks that may be incurred where insolvency proceedings are caused or impeded by environment-related issues. It shows how the unique relationship between lenders and insolvency practitioners greatly reduces the likelihood of direct liability from environmental regulations transferring to the lender during the liquidation process. Two regimes are analysed in this article: the contaminated land regime, and the waste licensing system. Statutory provisions and judicial decisions have limited the power of environmental regulators. At the same time, however, this is good for secured lenders who are principally concerned with repaying the debt that is owed to them by a defaulting borrower. A more significant concern for lenders during borrowers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 insolvencies are the indirect risks (that is, credit and security risks). Environmental issues arising during a borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insolvency may reduce the likelihood of the lender being repaid and, in the case of contaminated land, could severely limit the lender\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to exercise its security. \\xc2\\xa9 The Author(s) 2018.\"\\n\"Kadava A., Murthy S., Shaw A.R.\",\"Envisioning the LCA of a wastewater treatment plant\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056611582&doi=10.2166%2fWPT.2018.065&partnerID=40&md5=25b1409274cffbb0f5b17095ffe0755b\",\"In today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sustainability market where there are several tools to rate and grade the \\xe2\\x80\\x98green\\xe2\\x80\\x99 level of modern day infrastructure, the multi-tiered credit rating system called Envision provides an holistic approach to tackle the issue.

In Europe the most common system addressing the problem is the British system Building Research Establishment\\'s Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), American system Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), or German system Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Nachhaltiges Bauen (DGNB). The green building certificate comprises the assessment of noise impact generated by technical equipment of buildings on their external surroundings. The measures undertaken to counteract noise-generated pollution involve green certification, but it is also a global challenge to find appropriate technological solutions contributing to the protection of areas inhabited by people. We determined the impact of the surroundings of the assessed building in specific background noise conditions. We described the problem of appropriate selection of measurement points and the impact of noise generated by building installations on the acoustic assessment of green buildings in BREEAM system. A theoretical model of the simulated house was developed close to a road, with changes to traffic parameters including heavy vehicles and the summary acoustic power of the equipment mounted on the roof of the investigated house. We analysed the impact involving the location of the investigated building on the possibility to obtain \\'credits\\' in view of environmental acoustics. Instead of a single case study, we used simulation to illustrate different situations such as the changing acoustic background represented by the existing traffic system or changing noise of the sources represented by noise generating units. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 - 2018 IIAV.

The building sector accounts for a major share of its electricity consumption, reaching up to 70%. To encourage sustainable development and reduce energy consumption and emissions, the government introduced a sustainability initiative called \"\"Estidama\"\", which employs the use of the Pearl Building Rating System (PBRS). Government buildings, which constitute 20% of the built environment, aim to lead the way, and are therefore required to attain a high level of achievement, based on their PBRS ranking (minimum of two out of five pearls). Schools, led by Abu Dhabi Educational Council (ADEC), are governmental buildings and aim to attain a higher level of achievement (three out of five pearls). The ADEC plans to build one hundred schools to be built by 2020, through its Future Schools Program. Over half of the schools have been completed, but only 20% reached the targeted rating (of three out of five pearls). The Renewable Energy (RE) application in the UAE is minimal, although it represents 25% of the local rating code. The objective of this paper is to explore the sustainable performance of one representative school that did not reach the desired green rating level, with the objective to assess opportunities for an enhanced performance. This is done through testing the performance and the application of three RE systems comprising of photovoltaics (PV) array, an absorption cooling system and a geothermal cooling system through Transient Systems Simulation (TRNSYS) software. Cumulatively, implementation of these options results in RE potentially contributing to 19% of the school\\'s annual energy consumption, enhancing the school\\'s performance by up to 14 additional credit points, and reaching the target level of achievement (a three pearl rating). Furthermore, system integration of RE into the existing school were also considered. Results indicate the significant potential of integrating RE systems in future schools in hot climatic contexts, for an improved energy performance. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 MDPI AG.

According to Jason Moore, this represents the \\xe2\\x80\\x98end of Cheap Nature\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and signals a terminal crisis for capitalism as we know it. In this article we complicate this assertion by showing how, in the context of global environmental governance frameworks of carbon control, a diverse range of actors situated at multiple scales are intensifying the use of cities and their hinterlands for the production/transgression of localized commodity frontiers. We draw on scholarship on uneven geographical development, state-led restructuring and eco-scalar fixes to present two case studies from different segments of the carbon cycle in the global South. The first case demonstrates how the introduction of waste-to-energy technology in Delhi facilitated the generation of \\xe2\\x80\\x98carbon credits\\xe2\\x80\\x99 while waste matter itself became a commodity. The second discusses attempts by the Brazilian state of Amazonas (Amaz\\xc3\\xb4nia) aspiring to shift from rainforest exploitation to financialized conservation supported by the \\xe2\\x80\\x98green global city\\xe2\\x80\\x99 functions of metropolitan Manaus. These cases demonstrate that although the global carbon-control regime may enable accumulation, implementation remains speculative, and localized commodity frontiers provoke social resistances that jeopardize their durability. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 The Authors.

To address this significant knowledge gap, this study has two progressive objectives: (1) to ascertain the empirical effects of GB on CWM and; (2) to identify and understand the causes leading to the ascertained effects. This is achieved by triangulating quantitative \\xe2\\x80\\x98big data\\xe2\\x80\\x99 obtained from government agencies with qualitative \\xe2\\x80\\x98thick data\\xe2\\x80\\x99 derived from case studies and interviews. The study found that BEAM Plus, the latest version of the Building Environmental Assessment Method developed by the Hong Kong Green Building Council (HKGBC), gave rise to a 36.19% waste reduction by weight for demolition works, but no statistically significant waste reduction for foundation or building works. It is because CWM, the basis for a demolition project to obtain GB credits, makes up only one of many ways for foundation or building works to earn credits, e.g., site aspects, lighting. In any case, CWM measures typically prove costlier means of acquiring credit, further causing developers to pay less attention to CWM in their GB tactics. The study\\'s results, i.e., CWM in GB significantly influences demolition, but only marginally for foundation and building works, provide useful scientific evidence to inform GB councils and other responsible bodies and encourage continuous improvement in GB practices. While the study in general sheds light on how the triangulation of big, empirical data with conventional, qualitative data, e.g., interviews with GB professionals, helps to better understand the subject of the investigation, i.e., the effects of GB on CWM. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Pushkar S.\",\"A comparative analysis of gold leadership in energy and environmental design for new construction 2009 certified projects in Finland, Sweden, Turkey, and Spain\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052834207&doi=10.3390%2fapp8091496&partnerID=40&md5=0f352c9b8a82b0863743dcb6275f7e5b\",\"The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is currently intensively applied in several European countries.

Estimation results were obtained from a conditional logit, conditional logit with interaction terms, random parameter logit, random parameter logit with correlation, and individual-level coefficient models. A novelty of our analysis was the consideration of monetary and non-monetary incentives as factors influencing consumer uptake in green pricing programs. The estimation results show that increased consumer participation in green pricing programs is positively linked with green energy sources that produce fewer externalities, more jobs, and monetary incentives such as tax credits or green mileage. However, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between participation rates and the share of green electricity in total electricity supply. Mean willingness to pay for fuel cells is highest, followed by solar and wind energy. Estimation from the random parameter logit with allowing for correlations among random coefficients of attributes reveals that consumers are divided into \\xe2\\x80\\x98green (pro-environment) consumers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98blue (growth-oriented) consumers\\xe2\\x80\\x99.

This paper develops an analytical model that shows an additional benefit of sharing content locally: Selecting close by peers to share content from leads to shorter paths compared to traditional CDNs, decreasing the overall carbon footprint of the system. Using data from a month-long trace of over 3 million monthly users in London accessing TV shows online, we show that local sharing can result in a decrease of 24-48% in the system-wide carbon footprint of online video streaming, despite various obstacle factors that can restrict swarm sizes. We confirm the robustness of the savings by using realistic energy parameters drawn from two widely used settings. We also show that if the energy savings of the CDN servers are transferred as carbon credits to the end users, over 70% of users can become carbon positive, i.e., are able to support their content consumption without incurring any carbon footprint, and are able to offset their other carbon consumption. We suggest carbon credit transfers from CDNs to end users as a novel way to incentivise participation in peer-assisted content delivery. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 IEEE.\"\\n\"Dudi\\xc4\\x87 B., Smole\\xc5\\x88 J., Dudi\\xc4\\x87 Z., Mirkovi\\xc4\\x87 V.\",\"Support for foreign direct investment inflows in Serbia\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050893323&doi=10.21003%2fea.V169-01&partnerID=40&md5=9c250e5d8646bce7c8fe93215cfbe492\",\"The accession of Serbia to the European Union should bring stability, peace, justice, freedom and security to the Balkans.

Other big investors to Serbia are Russia (9% of the cumulative FDI inflows), Switzerland (6%), United Arab Emirates, China and USA (2% of the cumulative FDI inflows each). By investigating the open investment regime in the European Union, which is a basis for the development of economic relations and removal of barriers, the authors of the article present relevant measures in Serbia, which are acceptable to EU member states and define opportunities for job creation and increases in productivity of industries in Serbia. To promote exports and the inflow of foreign direct investments, the Serbian government has established such institutional mechanisms as the Development Agency of Serbia (RAS - SIEPA); the Export Credit and Insurance Agency of the Republic of Serbia; the Serbian Agency for the Development of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurship; the Development Fund of the Republic of Serbia; the European Agency for Reconstruction; the Free Zones Administration. The authors pay special attention to the case of the Serbian banking industry, which is a perfect example of the industry developed due to a significant amount of foreign direct investments. The banking sector is one of the most prospective sectors for foreign investors in Serbia, which was especially observed during the period of 2004-2011. As of 31 December 2016, 22 out of the 30 banks in Serbia are owned by foreign legal entities, which is a result of foreign direct investments in the Serbian banking sector and consolidation processes. Investments in the Serbian banking industry were implemented through 2 simultaneous and parallel channels: brown-field and green-field investments. Firstly, large investments in banking were recorded as greenfield investment and that was mainly due to the entrance of banks/banking groups, such as Procredit (Germany), Raiffeisenbank (Austria), HVB (Austria), Alpha Bank (Greece) and National Bank of Greece (Greece) together with Societe Generale Bank (France), into the Serbian market. Starting from 2002, there has been a lot of room for an increase of the market share of foreign banks in Serbia interested in the privatisation of Serbian banks or public ownership objects. Those banks were mostly presented by the European Union banks which operate in the region, for example: Hypo-Alpe-Adria Bank (Austria), Eurobank (Greece), Erste Bank (Austria) and OTP Bank (Hungary). Over time, the strong difference between green-field and brown-field investments in banking erased, as far as some of the banks which entered the Serbian market through green-field investments were active participants in the process of acquisition or privatisation of the former Serbian banks. Finally, this paper deals with future progress of the Serbian economy, based on the achieved results regarding foreign direct investment incentives. In other words, the improvement and stabilisation of Serbia\\'s credit rating and cooperation with relevant international financial institutions, such as the IMF and the EBRD, will result in a better image of Serbia. Consequently, the sustainable development of the Serbian economy, which could provide the continuity and presence of the country in respectable markets of the EU, can be achieved due to inflows of foreign direct investments, especially in industries such as the financial industry and the telecommunication industry. \\xc2\\xa9 Institute of Society Transformation, 2018.\"\\n\"Cattelan V.\",\"Islamic social finance: Entrepreneurship, cooperation and the sharing economy\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131776830&doi=10.4324%2f9781315272221&partnerID=40&md5=9bc1ac5520225cf5ef40d06f9ed4471b\",\"The current dynamics of world economy show remarkable changes in the socio-economics of credit provision and entrepreneurship. If the emergence of the sharing economy is fostering innovative models of collaborative agency, networking and venture business, economic actors are also looking for a more sustainable development, able to foster profitability as well as community welfare. This book investigates Islamic social finance as a paramount example of this economy under change, where the balance between economic efficiency and social impact is contributing to the transformation of the market from an exchange- to a community-oriented institution. The collected essays analyse the social dimension of entrepreneurship from an Islamic perspective, highlighting the extent to which the rationales of \"\"sharing,\"\" distribution and cooperation, affect the conceptualization of the market in Islam as a place of \"\"shared prosperity.\"\" Moving from the conceptual \"\"roots\"\" of this paradigm to its operative \"\"branches,\"\" the contributing authors also connect the most recent trends in the financial market to Shari\\'ah-based strategies for community welfare, hence exploring the applications of Islamic social finance from the sharing economy, FinTech and crowdfunding to microcredit, waqf, zakat, sukuk and green investments. An illuminating reference for researchers, practitioners and policy-makers dealing with the challenges of a global market where not only is diversity being perceived as a value to be fostered, but also as an important opportunity for a more inclusive economy for everybody. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 selection and editorial matter, Valentino Cattelan; individual chapters, the contributors.

Our approach removes third-parties such as credit reporting agencies from the lending process and replaces them with smart contracts. This allows customers to interact directly with the lenders or banks while ensuring the integrity, unmalleability and privacy of their credit data. Additionally, each customer has full control over complete or selective disclosure of her credit records, eliminating the risk of privacy violations or data breaches. Moreover, our approach provides strong guarantees for the lenders as well. A lender can check both correctness and completeness of the credit data disclosed to her. This is the first approach that can perform all credit reporting tasks without a central authority or changing the financial mechanisms. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 IEEE.\"\\n\"Deng L., Xu F., Ren Y., Bao S., He H., Li C.\",\"Resource allocation method based on combinatorial double auction mechanism in cloud computing\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050094727&doi=10.1109%2fICIEA.2018.8397823&partnerID=40&md5=5c51fef27e5794dc258d0a8ce672fdd0\",\"Cloud computing integrates kinds of resources into a huge resource pool and provides different types of resource combination in the resource pool to users in the form of service using virtualization technology.

Green finance has been growing rapidly in China since the government issued its Green Credit Policy. The objective of this study is to explore whether green loans are less risky than non-green loans. Based on a five-year dataset of 24 Chinese banks, we used panel regression techniques, including two-stage least square regression analysis and random-effect panel regression to examine whether a higher green credit ratio reduces a bank\\'s non-performing loan ratio (NPL ratio). The results suggest that allocating more green loans to the total loan portfolio does reduce a bank\\'s NPL ratio. We conclude that institutional pressure by the Chinese Green Credit Policy has a positive effect on both the environmental and the financial performance of banks. The study contributes to the literature on the correlation between green lending and credit risks, as well as to the literature on the impact of institutional pressure on environmental and financial risks. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 by the authors.\"\\n\"Li Y., Zhang Q., Liu B., McLellan B., Gao Y., Tang Y.\",\"Substitution effect of New-Energy Vehicle Credit Program and Corporate Average Fuel Consumption Regulation for Green-car Subsidy\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047601324&doi=10.1016%2fj.energy.2018.03.134&partnerID=40&md5=b4854876145c5bd50c7285edf8ed52da\",\"The green-car subsidy program since 2009 has been successfully used to boost the nation\\'s new-energy vehicle industry and cut vehicle emissions in China; however, it may cause financial burden on the governments at the same time.

I develop a jurisdictional model of credit trading under an intensity standard, framed in terms of a Renewable Portfolio Standard for electric utilities. I find that regulators of firms with low compliance costs always allow for inter-jurisdictional credit trade. Regulators of firms with high costs of compliance allow for credit trade under the condition that extra-jurisdictional credits count less towards compliance compared to credits generated within the jurisdiction. Counter-intuitively, increasing the stringency of the intensity standard when credit trading is possible can have the opposite of the intended effect and actually decrease renewable electricity generation. Using numerical simulations, I show that heterogeneity in terms of renewable costs or externalities across jurisdictions are not sufficient for inter-jurisdictional credit trading to be a stable equilibrium outcome. \\xc2\\xa9 2018\"\\n\"Wu P., Song Y., Hu X., Wang X.\",\"A preliminary investigation of the transition from green building to green community: Insights from LEED ND\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047792186&doi=10.3390%2fsu10061802&partnerID=40&md5=5546a5d48e6094370a999fb4896d1d56\",\"The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for Neighborhood Development (LEED ND) rating system has been considered one of the major tools to assess the performance of green communities. However, few studies have been conducted on how the traditional focus on green building can be effectively transitioned to green communities. In order to facilitate the transition process, this paper reviews and analyzes the credits obtained from LEED ND 2009 certified plans. A total of 55 projects were identified from the LEED project directory of the U.S. Green Building Council. The performance of these neighborhood development projects, including project landscape, percentage of achievement and predictors of LEED ND rating, was analyzed. The performance was then compared with the performance of green buildings certified under LEED New Construction (LEED NC). The results indicate that there is an unbalanced allocation of credits to economic, social and environmental sustainability in the LEED ND rating. In addition, green infrastructure and building credits, such as wastewater management, on-site renewable energy and solar orientation, have extremely low percentage of achievement, indicating that these credits should be redesigned. The results provide useful insights for developers to prepare for LEED ND certification and for regulatory bodies to improve the performance of the current LEED ND rating system. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 by the authors.\"\\n\"Yin S., Li B.\",\"Transferring green building technologies from academic research institutes to building enterprises in the development of urban green building: A stochastic differential game approach\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053077061&doi=10.1016%2fj.scs.2018.03.025&partnerID=40&md5=b2cee83a55461474bc09db5b41d1c5ce\",\"This paper presents a stochastic differential game of green building technologies (GBTs) transfer from academic research institutes to building enterprises in the building enterprises-academic research institutes collaborative innovation (BACI) system. Some random interference factors, for example the uncertain external environment and the mood of decision makers, are considered into three models which are Nash non-cooperative game model, Stacklberg master-slave game model and cooperative game model. The equilibrium strategies of building enterprises and academic research institutes are studied and discussed by using feedback control. The equilibrium results showed that the effort level of academic research institutes and building enterprises is proportional to the government subsidy of GBTs innovation, and the level of credit support and tax relief is proportional to the effort level of academic research institutes. The government subsidy of GBTs innovation is a long-term incentive mechanism which can promote GBTs transfer from academic research institutes to building enterprises in the BACI system. The Pareto optimality of GBTs transfer system can be reached under a cooperative game model. To reach the Pareto optimality, the scope of revenue distribution coefficient is given by analysis of revenue distribution mechanism. This study will contribute to the GBTs transfer from academic research institutes to building enterprises by providing some incentive mechanisms and the scope of revenue distribution coefficient. The findings from this study also adds to theoretical basis of incentive mechanisms, random factors, profit distribution and contract design for building enterprises and academic research institutes to make scientific decisions. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Ismaeel W.S.E.\",\"Midpoint and endpoint impact categories in Green building rating systems\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043574005&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2018.01.217&partnerID=40&md5=06645e647af91660c47663d10464cb3a\",\"Green building rating systems (GBRSs) address a variety of areas of protection to solve current environmental problems. This is more relevant to decision making but not as scientifically reliable as following the midpoint and endpoint approaches. The purpose of this paper is to pinpoint the lack of a standard base for carrying environmental assessment and show the interrelations between eleven most widely used GBRSs in these terms through a descriptive statistical analysis. The study adopts a qualitative and quantitative methodology through credits\\xe2\\x80\\x99 classification method, quantitative assessment and comparison on the level of midpoint and endpoint impact categories. The first step requires expanding the discussion to include different methods and levels of incorporating Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to support credits\\xe2\\x80\\x99 requirements. For other non-LCA based credits, a quantification index is used to express the contribution of each credit to the respective quantifiable inventory of midpoint impact categories. The analysis shows that the total weighted sum of midpoint and endpoint scores differ from one GBRS to another. Nevertheless, the correlation matrix indicates interrelations of some GBRSs which adopt similar approaches to address environmental problems. The study concludes that existing GBRSs although they have similar targets, they exhibit discrepancies in the base of their environmental assessment. This does not provide a robust base for comparing the outcome results and indicates the need for restructuring credits according to the midpoint and endpoint approaches. This investigation adds to the existing body of literature to demonstrate with evidence the need for using both approaches in a consistent framework for modelling environmental assessment. This allows optimum use of the benefits and overcomes existing gaps and limitations of both of them. This can assist GBRSs plan for future development in correspondence with national targets and international environmental initiatives. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Kume A.\",\"Correction to: Importance of the green color, absorption gradient, and spectral absorption of chloroplasts for the radiative energy balance of leaves (Journal of Plant Research, (2017), 130, 3, (501-514), 10.1007/s10265-017-0910-z)\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042214111&doi=10.1007%2fs10265-018-1014-0&partnerID=40&md5=d51da015c3f231e681ca73428a9b93b6\",\"The article \\xe2\\x80\\x9cImportance of the green color, absorption gradient, and spectral absorption of chloroplasts for the radiative energy balance of leaves\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, written by Atsushi Kume, was originally published Online First without open access. was originally published Online First without open access.

Financial development is measured by six individual indicators and by a comprehensive indicator obtained through the PCA method. We also account for regional heterogeneity by dividing our sample into three regions: eastern region, central region, and western region. We underline our findings in three aspects. First, financial development measured by most individual indicators (m2, credit, revenue of the insurance industry, and stock market value) and the comprehensive one has a significantly negative impact on economic growth. Second, energy consumption can significantly contribute to economic growth in all regions, while no feedback effect is found except in the western region. This result is further supported by the Granger causality tests. Last, financial development in the sense of m2, credit, stock turnover, and the comprehensive indicator can significantly lessen energy consumption in all regions. But this inhibitory effect is found to be largest in the western region, followed by the eastern region, and be smallest in the central region. The Granger causality tests confirm further the existence of heterogeneity across regions. A bidirectional Granger causality between the two variables is found in the eastern region, a unidirectional Granger causality running from energy consumption to financial development is identified in the central region, and no significant causal relationship shows up in the western region. Our findings provide valuable policy implications for China heading for a green economic growth. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 Elsevier B.V.\"\\n\"Diaz-Sarachaga J.M., Jato-Espino D., Castro-Fresno D.\",\"Evaluation of LEED for neighbourhood development and envision rating frameworks for their implementation in poorer countries\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041920142&doi=10.3390%2fsu10020492&partnerID=40&md5=5677e9b4c782e061f8608fb6d8b98814\",\"The unstoppable world population growth is increasing the concentration of people in urban settlements and the number of megacities, especially in developing countries where urbanization exacerbates social and economic inequalities. Green rating systems have been launched during the last decades to facilitate the assessment of sustainable development in terms of building and infrastructure, including the evaluation of sustainable urban development through the study of communities. This article assesses two of the most renowned sustainable rating systems through the prism of economy, environment and society and the international actions undertaken toward the promotion of sustainable development worldwide, in order to determine their effectiveness to assess urban development in poorer nations. Hence, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for Neighbourhood Development (LEED ND) and Envision, both from the United States, were chosen as representatives of building and infrastructure fields, respectively, so that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the New Urban Agenda (Habitat III) were the benchmarks selected to define the sustainability aspects required to evaluate their potential application in less developed countries. The absence of metrics in the New Urban Agenda led to relate its commitments to the SDGs, which revealed that the prerequisites and credits included in LEED ND and Envision mainly focused on managerial and environmental aspects and disregarded the economic and social dimensions. Consequently, the premises under which LEED ND and Envision were developed must be updated and complemented with the two latest guidelines recently adopted by the United Nations in the field of urban and sustainable development. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 by the authors.\"\\n\"Gurgun A.P., Arditi D.\",\"Assessment of energy credits in LEED-certified buildings based on certification levels and project ownership\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042490393&doi=10.3390%2fbuildings8020029&partnerID=40&md5=63cc2c2d123dc5ac3abe34c42cfb9eb7\",\"Compared to other categories, the Energy and Atmosphere category contributes the most to the maximum obtainable points in the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification system. The objective of the study was to identify the extent to which project teams take advantage of the credits in the Energy and Atmosphere category of LEED. This study analyzes the performance of practitioners in achieving points in the Energy and Atmosphere credits of LEED-New Construction (NC) 2009 for 1500 buildings that received LEED certification in the US. For a better understanding of the credit patterns, the differences in the performance of practitioners are investigated relative to certification levels and project ownership. Achievement in credits is calculated in terms of percent of maximum points (PMP), since the maximum achievable points differ for each credit. Practitioners\\' achievements in the credits were ranked as follows: (1) enhanced commissioning, (2) optimized energy performance, (3) enhanced refrigerant management, (4) green power, (5) measurement and verification, and (6) on-site renewable energy. The largest achievement differences were observed in the on-site renewable energy credit. Concerning building ownership, investors were found to optimize mostly energy efficiency and on-site renewable energy, but to mostly skip enhanced refrigerant management. Performance in the measurement and verification credit was similar for all owner types, whereas investors performed differently from corporations, and government agencies in the enhanced commissioning credit. Practitioners who recognize these priorities and differences are expected to be better positioned to make sustainability-related decisions in building design and construction. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 by the authors.\"\\n\"Clapp C.\",\"Investing in a green future\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041140147&doi=10.1038%2fs41558-018-0071-7&partnerID=40&md5=9d52e94fbf2c128a210c86206eb4b3f9\",\"The growing green bond market reflects the financial sector\\'s awakening to climate risk.

Here, we investigate the differences between the yield term structures of green and conventional bonds in the US municipal bond market. We show that, although returns on conventional bonds are on average higher than for green bonds, the differences can largely be explained by the fundamental properties of the bonds. Historically, green bonds have been penalized on the municipal market, being traded at lower prices and higher yields than expected by their credit profiles. In recent years, however, the credit quality of municipal green bonds has increased and the premium turned positive. Green bonds are thus becoming an increasingly attractive investment, with scope to bridge the climate finance gap for mitigation and adaptation. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 The Author(s).\"\\n\"Monasterolo I., Raberto M.\",\"The EIRIN Flow-of-funds Behavioural Model of Green Fiscal Policies and Green Sovereign Bonds\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027881953&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolecon.2017.07.029&partnerID=40&md5=e53877c9c9028455393579d0d7aa5e77\",\"Fiscal and monetary policies, as well as new financial instruments, could play a key role to meet the Paris Agreement.

We develop the EIRIN flow-of-funds behavioural model to simulate the introduction of green fiscal policies and green sovereign bonds, and we display their effects on firms\\' investments in the brown and green sector, on unemployment, on the credit and bonds market. EIRIN is Stock-Flow Consistent and is rooted on a balance sheet approach. It adopts a Leontief production function with no substitution of the production factors, i.e., Labour, Capital, and Raw Materials. Its sectors are endowed with adaptive behaviours and expectations, and interact with the others and the foreign sector through a set of markets.

Green sovereign bonds represent a short-term win-win solution, while green fiscal measures have higher immediate distributive effects that induce negative feedbacks on the economy. These results are influenced by the conditions (fiscal, budgetary and public debt/GDP) in which both measures are implemented. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 Elsevier B.V.\"\\n\"Papale G., Sgaglione L.\",\"SDD Sentinel: A Support Tool for Detecting and Investigating Electronic Transaction Frauds\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047395404&doi=10.1109%2fiThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2017.53&partnerID=40&md5=ecaeb27003febabfae6af049130f6327\",\"In the last few years public authorities, businesses and citizens of European Union are benefiting from a common payments area, namely the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), which reduces the cost and speeds up domestic and cross-border payments.

Due to the adverse impacts towards the environment from cement manufacturing, green building rating tools always give a significant consideration towards concrete usage in green buildings. Irrespective of its significance in green buildings, there is a clear lack of research on life-cycle cost (LCC) impact of using supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) in cement as required by green building rating tools. Therefore, this research analyses the life cycle costs of concrete using SCMs in obtaining concrete credits according to Green Star rating system in Australia. This research used fly ash, slag and silica fume as SCM for concrete. The SCM replacement percentage in concrete ranges from 10% to 60% as higher than 60% substitution is impractical. This research calculated LCC for each replacement percentage and specific building elements in different strength categories. LCC of concrete decreases with higher SCM replacement percentages. Further, there are only slight differences in LCC when comparing the three SCMs. In LCC, the contribution from the initial material cost is approximately 85%\\xe2\\x80\\x9387%, and in an exceptional situation such as in columns, this lowers to 66%.

The participants viewed the stimuli which consisted of an all-in-one printer with either one (greenwashed) or six (green) eco-friendly attributes and a fictitious brand name (Envyo) with a price of $399.99. We measured perceived monetary sacrifice, willingness to purchase the printer as well as three covariates. Results: An ANCOVA using individual preference for green products as a covariate showed a significant motivation x greenness effect on perceived sacrifice (F (1, 55)\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa04.75, p\\xc2\\xa0&amp;lt;\\xc2\\xa00.05) with no significant effects of the covariates.

Although consumers consider a product\\xe2\\x80\\x99s environmental attributes as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstructurally important features\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Gershoff and Frels 2015, p. 101), this study provides additional evidence that marketing efforts in the financial industry can also target peripheral rather than central attributes to maximize greenness perceptions by establishing the connection between consumer values and the choice of environmental cause. The existing literature highlights the importance of brand-cause fit by arguing that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca perceived match between the product\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brand and the cause it supported\\xe2\\x80\\x9d could greatly improve consumer perceptions toward cause-marketing campaigns and brand image (e.g., Ch\\xc3\\xa9ron et al. 2012, p. 362). In our research, however, the brand-cause fit is moderated by the individuals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 previous philanthropic experiences and biospheric values. Therefore, marketers should understand the environmental concerns of targeted audiences to effectively communicate with consumers. More importantly, marketers should clearly indicate the benefits of environmental consumption if they hope to convince ambivalent consumers (Burke et al. 2014). Consistent with the existing literature, individuals in the present study are more likely to have positive attitudes toward the brand and purchase intentions when they are presented with 1% cash and annual percentage rate (APR) donation compared to 0.5 and 1.5% donations. Thus, marketers should promise a sufficiently large donation when targeted consumers have positive attitudes toward helping behaviors (e.g., Koschate-Fischer et al. 2012). Companies may choose to donate a medium amount when brand-cause fit is low, and this donation amount matters if \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe product is utilitarian or consumed privately\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Koschate-Fischer et al. 2012, p. 923), such as a credit card in this study. Finally, the overall results suggest what mattered in our research was the donation framing in selecting \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d credit cards. Generally speaking, when the donation is framed as cash rewards, it has stronger effects on a consumer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perception and consequent reactions to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d credit cards than when the donation is framed as APR. When people believe that expenses \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill recur infrequently, they may fail to book the item in their budget, encoding the infrequent expense as trivial or irrelevant to their budgets at large\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Sussman et al. 2015, p. 131). As a result, cash reward donation framing has stronger effects on an individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perception of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d credit cards than APR. These findings provide financial institutions with an inexpensive and easy-to-implement method to encourage more generous donations to existing green causes. \\xc2\\xa9 2018, Academy of Marketing Science.\"\\n\"Polat G., Turkoglu H., Gurgun A.P., Yikilmaz N.\",\"Evaluation of credit achievements of leed-certified buildings\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116493625&doi=10.14455%2fISEC.res.2018.24&partnerID=40&md5=6c6a1ecfdaa2ec08b77a08d4338078be\",\"Nowadays, the concept of green building is no longer an alternative but a necessity. The acceptance of a building as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d depends on having a certificate. LEED is one of the widely used green building certification systems in Turkey. The main objective of this study is to find out whether there were statistically significant differences between the credit achievements of 105 newly constructed and certified buildings in Turkey, which were certified according to four different levels, and to determine which of these credit achievements are weak. For this purpose, Kruskal-Wallis and MannWhitney U tests were performed and the findings were interpreted. Findings revealed that the highest level of achievement of these buildings was in sustainable sites, water efficiency, innovation in design, and regional priority credits, while the lowest level of achievement was in energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, and indoor environmental quality credits. Analyses revealed that the achievements in the energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, and indoor environmental quality credits of green buildings are relatively low when compared to the ones in other credits. There may be several reasons behind these low levels of achievement such as poor green culture, high investment cost of necessary systems, absence of reusable, recycled, and renewable materials. If these problems, most of which are peculiar to developing countries, can be overcome, higher certification levels can be achieved. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 ISEC Press.\"\\n\"Lavoie M., Fiebiger B.\",\"Unconventional monetary policies, with a focus on quantitative easing\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116202435&doi=10.4337%2fejeep.2018.0037&partnerID=40&md5=c9bf9a102caa3d171462321b316070e9\",\"This article distinguishes between credit easing policies and quantitative easing (QE) policies.

Credit 7.1 requires that at a minimum 50% of the hardscape (roads, sidewalks, courtyards, and parking lots) be constructed using materials having a Solar Reflective Index (SRI) value of 29 or higher. LCAP is a process of designing and constructing asphalt pavements that meet this SRI requirement. The purpose of the development of LCAP is to provide developers looking to achieve LEED certification with a paving alternative that provides performance that is equivalent to conventional asphalt pavement, but that will also meet the requirement of LEED Credit 7.1. LCAP process includes aggregate selection, asphalt mix modification, placement of asphalt mix, stripping of surface asphalt film from new pavement, and evaluation of reflectivity of aggregates, mixes, and in-place pavements. The very light colour aggregate from Coco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Badgley Island Quarry is a suitable material for LCAP. Conventional new asphalt pavements have an SRI of about 5, and weathered asphalt pavements have an SRI of about 10. There are coatings and epoxy binder mixes available in the market that can be used to increase the SRI of asphalt pavements; however, these technologies are quite expensive, approximately five times more expensive than conventional asphalt. In the LCAP process, the required SRI should be achieved at somewhat increased cost for the final lift of asphalt only, significantly lower than current technologies available on the market. In order to have a successful LCAP, the following three requirements have to be achieved: \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 LCAP should meet the LEED requirement of SRI to be at least 29, at an additional cost of the surface asphalt lift that is acceptable to the user; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Meet conventional asphalt mix acceptance criteria for either Marshall or Superpave mixes; and \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 There shall be no adverse impact on long term pavement performance. The primary advantages of this technology, in addition to meeting the LEED SRI requirement, are the following: \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Decreased heat high island effect in urban areas; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Meeting the green standards being implemented by cities (e.g. City of Toronto), with a product that is cost comparable to the conventional product, and which provides equivalent performance; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Improved long term durability and resistance to cracking due to decreased rate of oxidation; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Enhanced frictional characteristics and macrotexture, at least early in the pavement life; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Energy savings due to decreased requirements for lighting; and Protection of the permafrost in the northern climates. \\xc2\\xa9 TAC 2018.\"\\n\"Bian J., Marchione F.\",\"Business Ethics and Chinese Overseas Investment\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090365871&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-10-8062-3_12&partnerID=40&md5=5e8bc6ac54a706a111efdd24975a8bb1\",\"Chinese overseas investment has undergone a significant increase in the last few years.

However, there are some concerns around whether the concept of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbusiness ethics\\xe2\\x80\\x9d has been widely implemented by the Chinese business circle. Furthermore, what are the key institutional designs to address this issue? Is there any law or regulation to regulate and enforce this concept? This paper, by studying the relevant regimes, aims to examine the above questions. The first part of this paper will review the development of Chinese overseas investment. Secondly, this paper looks at the legal and institutional framework for the regulation and supervision of overseas investment. Moreover, by a close examination of the current law, regulations and industrial guidelines relating to ethical requirements, conclusions will be drawn. \\xc2\\xa9 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\"\\n\"Elzeyadi I.M.K.\",\"Smart and healthy buildings factor of reality: A comparative analysis of green buildings performance between design predictions and actual performance\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086567210&partnerID=40&md5=af979c27b4cc7889175b6cac366984eb\",\"The US Green Buildings Council (USGBC) has created a market transformation program led by a certification process to promote, build, and renovate buildings into LEED\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 rated green facilities.

Due to a lack of systemic evaluation of buildings undergoing this certification process, however, the effects of this program on building resource utilization, indoor comfort, and occupant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s well-being remain contested. This paper reports on a cross-sectional survey study that investigates discrepancies between LEED certified buildings credits achieved as well as predicted and actual performance. The survey assessed 14 buildings, matched in pairs of two, of LEED and non-LEED buildings. Resource consumption and indoor environmental quality were assessed between both building pairs and their relationship to the LEED certification credits achieved. Results show that while LEED buildings outperformed their non-LEED comparatives, their resource consumption, however, exceeded their predicted expectations in most categories. In addition, the amount of credits achieved were not directly related to better performance.

Using a wide variety of financial development measures, as well as specific indicators capturing the level of state intervention in the financial system and the degree of market-driven financing in the economy, we examine whether limited access to finance acts as a barrier to reducing energy intensity. Our estimations control for variables such as state investment, stock market capitalization and the composition effect. Further, a GMM estimator is used to control for endogeneity in our models. Our results provide evidence that a poorly functioning financial system constrains the reduction of energy intensity across regions. However, the strength of these effects has been gradually declining over time, especially following the implementation of the Green Credit Policy. Limitations in domestic access to finance as well as the misallocation of funds and the efficient use of capital have policy implications, as they can reduce the incentives for investment in the energy sector. These findings are a source of considerable interest in light of the new policy based on green credit, and they highlight new opportunities as well as challenges to sustainable economic growth.

In this chapter, I will discuss how this scene gradually could change within the banking industry, mainly driven by regulators and rating agencies and potentially sudden market revaluations of climate-related risks. The chapter illustrates how banks, by using well-established methods, further developed by rating agencies could integrate climate factors into the credit decisions and become concerned consumers of corporate climate information. But the banking sector could face challenges in order to properly recognize and integrate climate-related risks in their risk management practices. Three such challenges are highlighted. Firstly, banks face practical difficulties when combining approaches to understand climate-related risks and translate them into quantitative measures of financial risks. Secondly, the current lack of relevant corporate climate information will create a challenge for banks to get relevant data for their models. Finally, a broader risk concept, which includes sustainability aspects could challenge traditional financial logics and create strong resistance on a psychological level. The chapter concludes that changes in banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 day-to-day credit risk management and disclosure practices, as a response to regulatory demands to better include climate-related factors, could gradually change the risk concept, as perceived by the banking industry. \\xc2\\xa9 The Author(s) 2019.\"\\n\"Vazzano T.A., Di Benedetto F., Stancanelli E., Ragaglia F., Sabbia A.\",\"Credit worthiness inside green finance.

The purpose of this paper is to propose the inclusion of the environmental compartment inside the process of evaluation of the credit worthiness, during the financing process granted by banks. To reach this purpose, an innovative research on environmental sensibility has been carried out through a specially elaborated questioner, which has also been completed by some industries on the agri-food sector in Sicily. The results, after being elaborated on purpose, they can be the base of a decisional support model for the evaluation of the grade of the environmental variable businesses\\' perception, which must be considered when bank calculates the score that it assigns to the firms. This research demonstrates that the action of consider environmental factor during evaluation of credit worthiness, it can become a winning strategy both as an incentive for enterprises both as a tool of rationalization of loans.

This paper examines the challenge of making sustainable investment structures in global health more attractive for mainstream financial markets. The objective is a framework for targeted future debate with financial sector actors. Four case studies of innovative sustainable investment mechanisms are analysed, elaborating potential transfer of green and impact investment models in order to channel additional private sector funds to health. To increase private sector involvement, profit must accrue to providers of finance. The paper shows how health criteria can be incorporated into structures, which create triple bottom line return opportunities. Health infrastructure projects based on risk sharing models with governments or multilateral agencies could use long-term funding, with better credit ratings and lower cost of capital. Outcomes based investment, similar to green or social impact bonds, with third-party certification of measurable health impact, satisfy the private sector need for return with social interest objectives. Responsible investment could expand by adding a \\'health\\' (H) criterion to the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) framework, implementing ESG+H for mainstream investment screening. These models are scalable, satisfy the need to dedicate funds to health and incorporate consistent critical success metrics. The conclusion finds that strong legal frameworks and exploration of fiscal incentives will be critical next steps to facilitate scaling up and broadening of interest from private sector financial actors. The impact these investments have on overall population health is a positive externality of sustainable global health investment. \\xc2\\xa9 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

However, the business case for this electricity based product (denoted hereafter as eMeOH) under current market conditions (e.g. vs. conventional fossil methanol (fMeOH) production cost) and the appropriate implementation scenarios to increase platform attractiveness and adoption have to be highlighted. The aim of the following study was to perform a dynamic simulation and calculation of the cost of eMeOH production (where electricity is generated at a wind park in Germany), with comparison made to grid connected scenarios. Consideration of these scenarios is made with particular respect to the German energy market and potential for the reduction in fees/taxes (i.e. for electrolyser systems). This evaluation and indeed the results can be viewed in light of European Union efforts to support the implementation of such technologies. In this context, CO 2 is sourced from EU relevant sources, namely a biogas or ammonia plant, the latter profiting from the resulting credit arising from CO 2 certificate trading. Variation in electricity cost and the CO 2 certificate price (in the presented sensitivity study) demonstrate a high cost reduction potential. Under the energy market conditions of Germany it is found that eMeOH production costs vary between \\xe2\\x82\\xac608 and 1453 per tonne based on a purely grid driven scenario, whilst a purely wind park supplied scenario results in \\xe2\\x82\\xac1028-1067 per tonne. The reported results indicate that the eMeOH production cost in Germany is still above the present (although variable) market price, with the economical evaluation indicating that electrolyser and H 2 storage represent the lion share of investment and operational cost. Substitution of fMeOH results in CO 2 avoidance costs between \\xe2\\x82\\xac365 and 430 per tonne of CO 2eq avoided for green methanol produced in Germany. The presented assessment indicates that the eMeOH production cost in Germany will reach market parity in ca. 2030-2035 with the price for the avoidance of CO 2eq turning from a cost to a benefit at around the same time. Optimistically, the cost is predominantly influenced by rapidly reducing renewable electricity costs as is already the case in South American and Arabic countries offering the potential for methanol production at a cost of &lt;\\xe2\\x82\\xac500 per tonne. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.\"\\n\"Lenzi D.\",\"The risk of environmental damage: A corporate governance perspective\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060511593&doi=10.1504%2fIJGE.2018.097497&partnerID=40&md5=9f3bb2ae14a6b2ebefe6d46d7c7b6efa\",\"Within the legal framework of European for-profit companies, this paper examines the role that corporate law can play in preventing environmental damages.

Production of cane sugar is one of Mexico\\'s main agro-industries; it conveys numerous positive socio-economic impacts and presents opportunities for productive diversification and enhanced profitability and competiveness. The sugar industry faces sustainability challenges due to the management of natural resources like soil, water, fossil fuels and agrochemicals, as well as the impacts of its greenhouse gas emissions and socio-economic constraints. However, sustainability of cane and sugar production cannot be assessed due to a lack of methodological frameworks for integrating economic and environmental indicators. We propose an index for Mexico\\'s sugar agro-industry that facilitates the identification of those system components that impact sustainability. This index is based on a reduced number of indicators aggregated through a multi-criteria evaluation using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). We apply this index to evaluate four sugar production systems in Mexico: producers of raw, refined, muscovado sugar and ethanol. Results show that systems with a high agro-industrial yield present better sustainability performance. This study is relevant because it provides quantitative information for decision makers towards a sustainable sugarcane agro-industry, based on the indicators used to build the sustainability index, to address actions as increase productive diversification by-products based, improve access to credit, irrigation, management practices and raw material quality reducing production costs, eliminate fossil fuel use in factories, make fertilizer application more efficient and reduce the area that is burned for manual harvest. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 Carlos Alberto Garc\\xc3\\xada-Bustamante et al.\"\\n\"Krishna B.V., Reddy S.S., Kumar R.P.\",\"An interdisciplinary open elective course learning & employment benefits: A case study on green building course\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058386082&partnerID=40&md5=526bd64d43564fab32ed719c0f76c410\",\"Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) is widely being practiced by many institutions in India since it has become signatory of the University Grants Commission (UGC).

Companies with high levels of greenhouse gas emissions or energy use are more likely to be exposed to the uncertainty related to future climate change risks. We measure the climate change risks faced by companies using information on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy consumption of companies that were announced in the Korean GHG Information Center from 2011 to 2015. We use the weighted average cost of capital provided by NICE Credit Information Co. Ltd., as a proxy for cost of capital.

Hospitals and hotels utilize large amounts of energy in water heating. A case study of one such facility was conducted at the National University of Malaysia Hospital (HUKM). At the hospital, large amounts of LPG were consumed by two boilers resulting in the release of considerable amounts of greenhouse gases. A solar water heater (SWH) was designed and integrated with existing LPG burners to develop a hybrid SWH system. The SWH system is composed of 144 U-type pipe evacuated solar panels divided into three blocks. Each block consists of 12 strings of panels connected in parallel, with each string comprising 4 panels. In 2012, the annual average solar irradiation in Kuala Lumpur was 4.5\\xc2\\xa0kW/m2/day.

We examine a low carbon distribution channel that consists of a manufacturer and a retailer, in which the retailer is constrained by capital. The retailer can be financed by bank credit from a competitive bank market. A Stackelberg model is developed to analyze the integrated decision-making process of ordering, financing, and emission reduction. By comparing the decentralized and centralized channels, we obtain that the manufacturer\\'s green technology investment should be linearly proportional to the retailer\\'s order quantity in both channels. Thus, a large order quantity leads to increased efforts to reduce emissions. Results further show that the centralized channel in some cases has fewer emissions and can generate more profits for the whole supply chain compared with the decentralized channel. We therefore propose a revenue sharing contract with a function form to coordinate the distribution channel. When the government allocates appropriate quotas to the supply chain, high carbon price can benefit the environment and supply chain efficiency. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 Jun Wang et al.\"\\n\"Usman A.M., Abdullah K.\",\"Comparative study on the Malaysian sustainable building rating systems\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049654812&partnerID=40&md5=5a09ced08a13bcab4a9d97512ee8cce9\",\"Sustainable building are buildings which have less impact on the environment and are assess with suitable assessment tools from rating systems. Hence many countries struggle to have these rating systems that suite the need of its stakeholders. The study compares the two widely accepted rating systems in Malaysia. These are Green Building Index (GBI) and Green Real Estate (GreenRE) are specifically design and developed for Malaysian tropical weather, environmental and development context, cultural and social needs. GBI rating system developed 15 assessment tools and GreenRE have 4 assessment tools therefore, only four assessment tools were compared. The total credits allocation are 100/154Cr, 100/183Cr and 100/184Cr and total parameters of 39Pr/24Pr, 51Pr/29Pr and 44Pr/30Pr for RNB, NRNB, NREB assessment tools for GBI/GreenRE respectively. Among the criteria, energy, water, indoor and outdoor environmental qualities were given high priority with high credit and parameters allocation. GreenRE give more priority in EEF and WEF category as compared to GBI with putting more priority over GreenRE in the remaining as it consider more categories of buildings, parameters in the remaining criteria and higher rating grade. It is easier to score credits and attain high ratings in the GreenRE assessment tools than GBI assessment tools even though in both the sustainability issues considered are similar.

All the tools are pointing to a single similar objective that is the implementing the principle of sustainability in the Malaysian build environment and hence they are both suitable for assessing Malaysian buildings.

Current smart grid systems lack practical large-scale energy storage capabilities and therefore their supply and demand levels must always be kept equal in order to avoid system instability and failure. Grid balancing has become more relevant in recent years following the increasing desire to integrate more Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) into the generation mix of modern grids. RESs produce intermittent energy supply that can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always be predicted accurately [1] and necessitates that effective balancing mechanisms are put in place to compensate for their supply variability [2, 3]. In this work, we propose a new energy curtailment scheme for balancing excess RESs energy using data centers as managed loads. Our scheme uses incentivized inter-datacenter workload migration to increase the computational energy consumption at a destination datacenter by the amount necessary to balance the grid. Incentivised workload migration is achieved by offering discounted energy prices (in the form of Energy Credits) to large-scale cloud clients in order to influence their workload placement algorithms to favor datacenters where the energy credits can be used. Implementations of our system using the CPLEX ILP solver as well as the Best Fit Decreasing (BFD) heuristic [4] for workload placement on data centers showed that using energy credits is an effective mechanism to speed-up/control the energy consumption rates at datacenters especially at low system loads and that they result in increased profits for the cloud clients due to the higher profit margins associated with using the proposed credits. \\xc2\\xa9 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.\"\\n\"Springer J.P.\",\"The cinema\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048396127&doi=10.1017%2f9781316755204.035&partnerID=40&md5=e17695f8d672e26654da76e0cd2930a6\",\"Filmmakers have long been drawn to Melville\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fiction, yet they have produced few successful cinematic adaptations. The density of his prose style combined with the challenge of finding visual analogues capable of transferring Melville\\xe2\\x80\\x99s complex, often ambiguous, themes and ideas to the screen, are obvious reasons for the small number of film adaptations. Of the handful of films based on Melville\\xe2\\x80\\x99s writing, few have managed to transfer either the narratives or the characters of his work to the screen without significant alteration. Though a few good films have been produced, the overall results have been disappointing. The early novels of South Seas adventure, Typee (1846) and Omoo (1847), are episodic tales that display native life with a moral candor that shocked Melville\\xe2\\x80\\x99s readers in his own time, and would hardly pass the objections of the Hollywood Production Code during the studio era. The 1935 MGM film The Last of the Pagans was a formula \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPolynesian love story\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with a loose connection to Melville\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Typee, though the book is not mentioned in the credits, and the screenplay was written by John Villiers Farrow, based on an original story. Directed by Richard Thorpe and shot on location in Polynesia, the film seemed more indebted to Robert Flaherty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Moana (1926) than to Melville\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work. In 1949 a low-budget \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexploitation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d film was released, entitled Omoo Omoo the Shark God, that was, according to the credits, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbased on the novel by Herman Melville;\"\" however, the film has no connection to his work. Directed by Leon Leonard and based on a screenplay by Leonard and George D. Green, Omoo Omoo the Shark God is an absurd melodrama constructed out of stock footage and shot on backlot jungle sets that concerns the theft of two black pearls - the eyes of the Shark God - and the resulting curse that befalls those who possess them. \\xc2\\xa9 Cambridge University Press 2018.\"\\n\"Dev S.M.\",\"Farm and non-farm sector linkages and future of agriculture\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047857720&partnerID=40&md5=e983241ef8fdf3fcd031b3923d17a352\",\"Non-farm linkages and future of agriculture are reviewed in the study. Some studies say non-agriculture and urban growth are important for reduction in poverty. Some other studies indicate agriculture and rural growth are important. The author\\'s view is that we should have a balanced approach towards agriculture, rural non-farm sector and urban growth for raising employment and reducing poverty. But, focusing on agriculture is still important for reduction in poverty as it is the biggest provider of livelihoods and has forward and backward linkages with other sectors. The government wants to have second green revolution by diversifying agriculture in crop sector and allied activities like shift from cereals to horticulture crops. Small farmers have difficulties to access inputs, credit and extension or to market their output. For shifting labour force from agriculture to non-agriculture, skill development is constraint in India. In order to have structural change from agriculture to non-agriculture and from unorganised to organised, education and skill improvement are needed. More innovative methods may be required to improve skills faster.\"\\n\"Barlindhaug R., Nordahl B.I.\",\"Developers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 price setting behaviour in urban residential redevelopment projects\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047351233&doi=10.1108%2fJERER-03-2017-0014&partnerID=40&md5=c2bac0697672b6125454b0c44d309697\",\"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate whether developers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ask lower prices on homes in redevelopment sites than they do on similar units in smaller developments completed over a shorter time span. It also investigates whether developers price units differently at different stages of the redevelopment process. The development of designated redevelopment areas often consists of multiple projects spread across several years, some in parallel, some sequential. New units are put on the market in a piecemeal fashion, and infrastructure, shared green spaces and shared facilities are installed successively. Design/methodology/approach: A hedonic price model is used to analyse sales prices of 7,000 new apartments in Oslo sold between 2011 and 2015, all else being equal. The paper distinguishes between infill as one-stage projects, and multi-staged competitive and multi-staged monopolistic redevelopments. Findings: Dwellings in redevelopment projects sell at a lower price than similar dwellings in infill projects. In competitive redevelopments, those in charge of the last projects put a slightly higher price on apartments. In redevelopments involving only one developer, the last stages ask the lowest prices. Research limitations/implications: This research expands our understanding of developers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pricing behaviour. Developers supplying housing for the private market through redevelopments land are willing to take risks particularly in the initial stage. Practical implications: The findings indicate that credit institutions financing developers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 projects need to take into account the structure of selling prices, including lower prices and higher risk of pursuing redevelopment projects. Social implications: Gaining a better understanding of developers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pricing behaviour deepens our insights into the dynamics of market-led urban brownfield developments; this knowledge may moreover inform policies on sustainable urban growth. Originality/value: An original investigation of housing transactions in urban brownfield sites in Oslo provides fresh insights into developers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pricing behaviour. \\xc2\\xa9 2018, Rolf Barlindhaug and Berit Irene Nordahl.\"\\n\"Alex David S., Ravikumar S., Rizwana Parveen A.\",\"Raspberry Pi in computer science and engineering education\",2018,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045331934&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-10-8575-8_2&partnerID=40&md5=3a46ff6eec7f33d6b3819dd01368a454\",\"Sustainable Environmental Development is one of the hot topics nowadays. Industries were advised to reduce and control pollution by using pollution control equipment. Computers are also contributing some amount in the pollution and power consumption. On the other hand, miniaturization, less power consumption, and environment-friendly devices are invented by the researchers every day. One such device is Raspberry Pi. Size of the Raspberry Pi is not bigger than a credit card with high computing capacity and low power consumption. Pi can run Linux as well as Windows 10 in its higher versions. This paper aims to suggest the Pi can be used for practicing most of the laboratory courses in the computer science engineering curriculum. Most laboratory courses are practiced in C, C++, and Java languages. Apart from above-mentioned languages, some laboratory courses make use of front end and back end tools. Above-mentioned languages can be executed in Raspberry Pi. Following points are analyzed between normal computer and Pi, execution time, power consumption, and environmental effect.

His novel, Far Tortuga, for example, features a group of twentieth-century Caribbean turtle fisherman hunting a dwindling population of green turtles, a species which had provided a measure of economic support for Caribbean communities for centuries. The spare prose of that novel arises from Matthiessen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impression of the sand-scrubbed, sun-blasted austerity of the seascape of the novel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s setting, and it underscores as well the difficulties faced by fishermen whose quarry was growing harder and harder to locate. At Play in the Fields of the Lord is set in the biologically riotous Amazon rainforest of Peru, and the novel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s language and complex plot reflect the abundance of the forest in which the novel is set. Most interesting is that in its treatment of women, the forest, the forces arrayed to exploit the forest, and the treatment of the native tribes that inhabit the rainforest landscape of the novel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s setting, Matthiessen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s novel, published in 1965, anticipates ecofeminist conceptual tropes that would only first be articulated by cultural critics more than a decade later. Greta Gaard credits Susan Griffith\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Woman and Nature (1978), Carolyn Merchant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s The Death of Nature (1980), and Mary Daly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Gyn/Ecology (1978) as among the founding texts of ecofeminism that \\xe2\\x80\\x9clinked oppressions of gender, ecology, race, species and nation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Gaard 2011, 28).

Oppressions of gender, ecology, and race are central to Matthiessen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s artistic purpose, and his understanding of the complex interplay of oppressive patriarchal Western encroachment with the forest and the indigenous people who live there, as well as some female characters in the novel, provides for an illuminating reading of At Play in the Fields of the Lord in an ecofeminist context. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 selection and editorial matter, Douglas A.

The results show that significant differences can be identified on most rating categories, including sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, indoor environmental quality, and innovation in design. Using a post hoc analysis, country-specific credit allocation patterns are also identified to help developers to understand existing country-specific green building practices. In addition, it is also found that there is unbalanced achievement of regional priority credits. The study offers a useful reference and benchmark for international developers and contractors to understand the regional variations of LEED 2009 and for regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Green Building Council, to improve the rating system, especially on designing regional priority credits. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 by the authors.\"\\n\"Bell C.\",\"Labour and tenancy in retrospect: Two bihari villages in 1970\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052966875&doi=10.1093%2foso%2f9780198812555.003.0016&partnerID=40&md5=bb5676509d66f092d1f6b3475ffa2fe1\",\"The object of this chapter is to describe and analyse the workings of labour, land, and credit markets of two villages in Bihar, four decades back, when the so-called \\'green revolution\\' promised much-and certainly occupied the attention of academics and practitioners alike.

Previous studies show that if the GB certification credits to be fulfilled are selected without considering project team attributes, then elevated levels of time, money, and labor could get wasted while attempting to meet the additional requirements of GB certification. The aim of this study is to develop a multi-attribute decision making (MADM) support tool to be used by GB experts to select the appropriate GB certification credits based on the project team attributes. The developed framework with relative weights assigned via the Delphi method was used to perform the MADM analysis, which employs the hybrid use of the Multi Attribute Utility Technique (MAUT) and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). This paper presents the developed MADM tool (i.e., GB-CS tool) and the relative weights of the attributes that were determined following expert opinions. To validate the tool, a case study was conducted at a LEED-registered residential project. The results show that the GB-CS Tool was successful in ranking the GB certification credits to be selected. This hybrid MADM tool can be used for preventing disruptions and bottlenecks in GB project delivery processes by assisting the owners/GB consultants in effectively selecting suitable GB certification credits based on the project team attributes. Thus, with the assistance of the GB-CS tool, root causes of waste can be mitigated in the GB project delivery process, decreasing associated hidden costs. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Eisenstein W., Fuertes G., Kaam S., Seigel K., Arens E., Mozingo L.\",\"Climate co-benefits of green building standards: water, waste and transportation\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84984693580&doi=10.1080%2f09613218.2016.1204519&partnerID=40&md5=a0b701e8d8a7014b37786e789c907fd9\",\"This paper quantifies the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions co-benefits associated with water, waste and transportation usage in certified green commercial office buildings in California. The study compares the measured values of water, waste and transportation usage self-reported by office buildings certified under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating system for Existing Building Operations and Maintenance (LEED EBOM) to baseline values of conventional California office buildings. The green buildings in the LEED EBOM dataset produced 50% less GHGs due to water consumption than baseline buildings, 48% less due to solid waste management, and 5% less due to transportation. If applied to the entire California office building stock, performance typical of the certified green buildings would save 730,038 MgCO2e/yr (metric tonnes) from transportation, 87,601 MgCO2e/yr from water, and 45,280 MgCO2e/yr from waste, for a total potential savings of about 862,920 MgCO2e/yr relative to conventional construction. In addition, buildings earning additional credits for specified performance thresholds for water and waste in the LEED EBOM code attained performance levels even higher than required by the code provisions, suggesting that such code provisions in other contexts may help incentivize larger GHG emissions reductions than anticipated.

Such changes in LEED versions strongly affect the energy performance and LEED scores of the target building in the LEED certification process. Therefore, to validate and improve the current LEED version, it is crucial to investigate and compare the impact of different LEED versions on the building energy performance and scoring scheme. However, researches comparing the sustainability metrics for mid-rise multi-family buildings are rare. Therefore, this paper investigates the potential changes in the energy performance resulted from applying different LEED versions (i.e., LEED v3 and v4) for the Energy and Atmosphere (EA) category. Towards this end, a case study was carried out with energy modeling and simulation using TRACE 700 to compare the changes in the energy performance of four analysis scenarios applied to an existing mid-rise multi-family building located in Ohio. Results showed notable changes in LEED points when different versions of LEED using different ASHRAE Standards (i.e., ASHRAE Standards 90.1-2007 and 90.1-2010) are applied for the building energy analysis. In particular, mid-rise multi-family buildings could benefit from LEED v4 in terms of LEED credits as the prerequisite for the minimum energy performance improvement in EA category became significantly lenient compared to LEED v3. On the contrary, when the percentage energy performance improvement is over 34%, mid-rise multi-family buildings would benefit from LEED v3 as it becomes difficult to gain more points for similar energy performance improvement in LEED v4 compared to LEED v3. Various stakeholders including USGBC and government can benefit from using the key findings of this study for improving the LEED certification and national energy standards. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Johnson A.M., Shailesh K.R., Mathew M.\",\"Energy efficient lighting design for a food processing industry located at composite climate of India\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037351819&doi=10.1109%2fICCPCT.2017.8074231&partnerID=40&md5=78036abd03cf0ad1eb9128c52bec4a78\",\"Lighting is one of the major energy consuming sector in any type of buildings.

However, there is a clear lack of research on establishing a baseline to develop new green building rating tools and to evaluate existing green building rating tools. Therefore, this research aims to establish key credit criteria based on an extensive literature study and evaluate these criteria based on widely used eight green building rating tools. The comparison analysis is based on a quantitative measure, namely, a normalised score, which is obtained through allocating credit points of selected green building rating tools to the established key credit criteria. The comparison result is presented with radar diagrams and bar charts. This research established seven key credit criteria for these rating tools which are namely (1) Site, (2) Energy, (3) Water, (4) Indoor Environment Quality (IEQ), (5) Material, (6) Waste and pollution, and (7) Management.

We believe that this paper can form part of the effort to reduce information asymmetry and the transaction costs of wind power project finance, as well as mobilize green finance investments from the financial sector to renewable energy projects to achieve a national renewable energy policy. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 by the authors.\"\\n\"Fourie E., Verster T., van Vuuren G.W.\",\"Development and comparison of payment behaviour prediction models for two South African state departments\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031491845&doi=10.4102%2fsajems.v20i1.1701&partnerID=40&md5=bc63092ab5172770b268347c8e0f246a\",\"Background: No credit rating methodology currently exists for any of South Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sub nationals. Aim: To develop a generic, quantitative credit rating methodology for the Department of Health and the Department of Education combined, as well as specific quantitative credit rating methodologies, for each department, individually. Setting: A comparison between generic and specific subnational credit rating methodologies to assess which fits the South African subnational environment best. Studies and results obtained from other nations were used to construct the approach. Methods: In a typical credit rating methodology, both quantitative and qualitative information is considered. In South Africa (as a developing economy), the quantitative information equates to a smaller portion of the final credit rating. A generic quantitative credit rating methodology, as well as specific credit rating methodologies, was developed. The appropriateness of these generic and specific models was tested with regards to prediction accuracies using Red, Amber or Green (RAG) statuses on a traffic light series. An illustration of the predicted versus actual ranks is provided, as well as an example to illustrate how model-predicted RAG statuses, based on quantitative information, may be overlaid with more recent qualitative information to derive a final ranking. Results: A generic, quantitative credit rating methodology for the Departments of Health and the Department of Education combined was developed, as well as specific credit rating methodologies for each department separately. The specific subnational credit rating methodology outperformed the generic methodology considerably; more precisely, the generic models predicted a maximum of 50% of the new cases correctly as opposed to the specific Health and Education models\\xe2\\x80\\x99 78%. Conclusion: The primary contribution of this study was to develop and compare generic and specific subnational credit rating methodologies.

The optimization model that was previously developed is now extended to incorporate the risk associated with the uncertain nature of the flaring events that are probabilistically characterized based on empirically meaningful historical samples. The model aims at minimizing the total annualized cost including fixed and operating costs of the system, the value of by- and co-products (i.e., power, excess heat), and regulatory taxes/credits associated with Green House Gases (GHGs). A base case ethylene production plant is presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach and highlight trade-offs between different performance objectives (economic, environmental and energy-related). The results show that some of the examined factors (i.e., CO2 tax savings) can be severely affected by small variations in flaring profiles, whereas others are only slightly affected by such variability (i.e., power vs. heat generation curves, fixed and operating costs). Therefore, the uncertain nature of flaring events may be of high importance in process performance and should be inevitably considered during abnormal situation management. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 Elsevier B.V.\"\\n\"Saxena N., Singh S.R., Sana S.S.\",\"A green supply chain model of vendor and buyer for remanufacturing\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033576162&doi=10.1051%2fro%2f2016077&partnerID=40&md5=9eb9f90d2c79254a90006b44eabcade6\",\"Due to environmental protection and limited resource utilization at optimum level, remanufacturing of defective products or reused products is an essential strategy in green supply chain inventory control system. This paper presents a green supply chain inventory model for integrated production of new items and remanufacturing of redeemable returned items under a situation in which the vendor provides the buyer with a permissible delay of payments and supplies the serviceable items to the buyer on lot-for-lot basis. It is assumed that every member of the chain is ready to collaborate for the maximum benefit of the supply chain. A mathematical formulation is developed to derive the optimal number of deliveries and the replenishment cycle time for the integrated vendor-buyer inventory model. Theoretical results show the global optimality of the solution and it is concluded that the collaboration is profitable for the chain and participating members reach the optimal level under co-operative decision making. Numerical analysis is given to illustrate the theoretical results. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is reported to study the effect of various parameters. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 EDP Sciences, ROADEF, SMAI .\"\\n\"Feng M., Staum J.\",\"Green simulation: Reusing the output of repeated experiments\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033222978&doi=10.1145%2f3129130&partnerID=40&md5=4ed94ab0c0d945b64bbffc35e966bbf7\",\"We introduce a new paradigm in simulation experiment design and analysis, called \"\"green simulation,\"\" for the setting in which experiments are performed repeatedly with the same simulation model. Green simulation means reusing outputs from previous experiments to answer the question currently being asked of the simulation model. As one method for green simulation, we propose estimators that reuse outputs from previous experiments by weighting them with likelihood ratios, when parameters of distributions in the simulation model differ across experiments. We analyze convergence of these estimators as more experiments are repeated, while a stochastic process changes the parameters used in each experiment. As another method for green simulation, we propose an estimator based on stochastic kriging. We find that green simulation can reduce mean squared error by more than an order of magnitude in examples involving catastrophe bond pricing and credit risk evaluation. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 ACM.\"\\n\"Bogacheva O.V., Smorodinov O.V.\",\"Challenges to green finance in G20 countries\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032883553&doi=10.20542%2f0131-2227-2017-61-10-16-24&partnerID=40&md5=0f80f14c6e5fd7da9f88d7115bb07c50\",\"Financial support for transition to sustainable social and economic development is one of the major challenges for most of G20 countries. To complete this task, key stakeholders have to overcome multiple barriers. According to international experts, several challenges are recognized as top priorities. Without addressing them G20 countries might not succeed in bridging the increasing financial gap between the needs of green economy and currently available investment opportunities. Such challenges are analyzed in the article. Among them are: 1) absence of common definition of green finance and lack of international standards; 2) insufficient correlation of targets of sustainable growth with priorities of national investment policy; 3) absence of regulatory and legal framework directly related to green finance; 4) ecological externalities; 5) maturity mismatch; 6) poor green project selection and management; 7) information asymmetry at the capital markets; 8) lack of analytical tools and expertise in identification and assessment of green projects\\' risks. The authors explain how each of the considered challenges hampers realization of green financing potential and analyze the best practice in addressing them. It is stated that solution of the abovementioned problems requires strong support from the governments of the G20 countries. At present, these countries implement such measures, as: introduction of appropriate regulatory and legal framework, stimulation of development market mechanisms and instruments of green financing (green bonds, credits, indices, etc.), formation of conditions aimed at elimination of asymmetry of information, fostering private-public partnership. Development of new international standards aligned with the requirements of sustainable growth and green financing is also under way in G20 countries. It is also noted that several challenges (namely, environmental externalities and green projects\\' risk evaluation) require additional efforts from G20 countries, both at the national and global levels.\"\\n\"Liu J.-Y., Xia Y., Fan Y., Lin S.-M., Wu J.\",\"Assessment of a green credit policy aimed at energy-intensive industries in China based on a financial CGE model\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84951000441&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2015.10.111&partnerID=40&md5=5852253556ca50d499f1d0fdcc070a64\",\"A financial computable general equilibrium model is established to quantitatively calculate the systematic effects of a green credit policy. The punitive high-interest rate is applied to the energy-intensive industries as the green credit policy. This study is focused on the following industries: paper, chemical, cement, and iron and steel. Short-, medium- and long-term scenarios are used to conduct experiments representing the green credit policy. Then, a scenario is simulated wherein a green security policy and the green credit policy are carried out simultaneously. Finally, effects of the green credit policy, a differential electricity price policy, and a raised production tax policy towards the energy-intensive industries are compared. The results show that the green credit policy is effective in suppressing the investments in energy-intensive industries, and it is comparatively less effective in adjusting the industrial production structure. The green security policy helps the green credit policy to reduce the total financing of the target industries, but it brings more negative impacts on the economy. Although the policies of differential electricity prices and raising production taxes support the output structural adjustments, their negative effects are much larger than those of the green credit policy. \\xc2\\xa9 2015 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Shin M.H., Kim H.Y., Gu D., Kim H.\",\"LEED, its efficacy and fallacy in a regional context-An Urban heat island case in California\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029756190&doi=10.3390%2fsu9091674&partnerID=40&md5=6d54c6a1f92f5394b2a20599df1d586e\",\"The use of energy in the building sector has increased rapidly over the past two decades.

However, the questions still remain in regard to how positively green buildings affect regional surroundings.

Using GIS with spatial regression, the study found that constructing an LEED building in a 30-m boundary could possibly lower the temperature of the surrounding environment by 0.35 \\xc2\\xb0C.

However, since additional costs for LEED certification cannot be estimated before proceeding with certification projects, financial losses are often incurred. Additional construction costs are the most significant issue faced by enterprises aiming for LEED certification. Rough estimates of the range of additional construction costs are available, but it is difficult to identify factors that increase or decrease the price of a building. Thus, there is a need for a program that provides average data for LEED certification costs and suggests the easiest way to attain credits for a building. Considering that LEED certification is a rating system, this study develops an optimization algorithm that aims to derive the minimum score for a desired LEED level at minimal cost. Credits are studied and classified by their difficulty and the required cost, allowing for an algorithm that can suggest a customized approach to acquire the minimal required score. The practical, data-driven program developed herein helps shorten the consulting process and increases the accessibility of LEED certification. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 by the authors.\"\\n\"Nellen A.\",\"In the green classroom-tax policy of environmental tax rules and incentives: New directions in teaching and research\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039918283&doi=10.3992%2f1943-4618.12.4.163&partnerID=40&md5=5db06785d41c20ee07c7f2fc0808aa9b\",\"There is no shortage of tax rules that address energy and natural resources in some manner.

However, these approaches have been found to be associated with negative potential impact on the health and safety of field personnel. Prevention through Design (PtD) strategies are well-suited to prevent potential construction hazards in green jobs. The aim of this study is to examine the perception of construction industry professionals about incorporating PtD practices into sustainable design and construction. To gauge the perception of professionals, a survey questionnaire was developed and distributed to two construction industry groups (designers and constructors). The present study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing evidence of the level of viability and extent of implementation of PtD practices into sustainable design and construction as well as identifying prevailing barriers and potential enablers of PtD implementation in the AEC industry. The findings of this research indicate that a majority of construction industry professionals, especially designers, are resistant to the implementation of PtD practices into sustainable projects at this point in time. Fear of liability, contractual methods, and lack of safety knowledge were found to be the most prevailing barriers to the acceptance of PtD practices within the AEC industry. By contrast, ethics was regarded as the primary potential enabler for the implementation of PtD practice within the AEC industry. The authors recommend that the AEC industry move further toward collaborative project delivery methods. This transformation can facilitate a wider implementation of PtD practices within the AEC industry, especially in sustainable design and construction. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.\"\\n\"Dewar G., Plenderleith D., Jackson S., Eady A.\",\"Employing micro gas chromats for flare analysis to meet emission regulations\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030238910&doi=10.23919%2fPCICEurope.2017.8015055&partnerID=40&md5=344758b5e2dc426a06d3355717cf44ec\",\"Climate change is one of the most pressing worldwide challenges particularly following the 1997 Kyoto protocol.

The researchers conducted a credit-by-credit review of the leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED) rating system to evaluate the potential positive or negative impact of green design elements and construction practices associated with the implementation of LEED credits on the OHS of construction and maintenance workers. The researchers also quantified OHS risk associated with LEED credits on 41 green projects distributed across the United States. The results show that even though a large number of LEED credits are neutral toward OHS, sustainable construction represented by LEED projects is associated with an increase in base-level safety risk. Finally, a risk model was integrated into a risk plane analysis to classify safety risk associated with each of the LEED credits. The risk classification analyses indicate that two credits are associated with unacceptable risk to OHS across the United States construction industry. It is expected that the findings from this research will benefit safety professionals, academics, designers, and all construction stakeholders by providing evidence of how their chosen sustainable designs may impact OHS on building projects. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.\"\\n\"Nassani A.A., Aldakhil A.M., Qazi Abro M.M., Zaman K.\",\"Environmental Kuznets curve among BRICS countries: Spot lightening finance, transport, energy and growth factors\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018612464&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2017.04.025&partnerID=40&md5=115979e8c4f1b2e90019f05c56e6ecc0\",\"The environmental sustainability reforms considered the highly successful factor for the countries that devoted for green investment in transportation, financial activities, energy demand, and growth factors.

Pixel-scale vegetation indices, sub-pixel fractional green vegetation cover for individual plants, and estimates of the fractional coverage of the grazing plants within entire plots, were extracted from the high-resolution images. Carbon stocks were correlated with both canopy coverage (R2: 0.76-0.89) and spectral-based vegetation indices (R2: 0.77-0.89) with or without the use of the near-infrared spectral band. Indices derived from the dry season image showed a stronger correlation with field measurements of carbon than those derived from the green season image.

The approach of using canopy cover to refine estimates of carbon yield has broader application in shrublands and woodlands. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 by the authors.\"\\n\"Chen X., Yang H., Wang T.\",\"Developing a robust assessment system for the passive design approach in the green building rating scheme of Hong Kong\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018283957&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2017.03.191&partnerID=40&md5=65f9d03215afaca6c52b9c9439dae60b\",\"This paper proposed a renovated passive design assessment system for green building labelling based on robust energy end-use statistics, different global sensitivity analysis methods, modelling experiments and a detailed case study. The developed system is only applied to cooling and lighting related criteria, which are mainly influenced by selected passive design strategies. After a preliminary definition of the assessment framework and total available credits, the priorities of different sub-criteria are derived from sensitivity analyses of a generic building model with screening-based, variance-based and regression methods. Adjustment of assessment criteria is also performed according to significance tests and post optimization analyses. Furthermore, performance and grading scales are formulated with baseline requirements, optimization results and local sensitivity analyses. Eventually, the FAST (Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test) method is proved to generate the most appropriate weighting system considering the consistence of the credit prediction with the traditional whole building simulation approach. Findings from this research can guide decision-makers in the construction industry to obtain an optimized preliminary design by properly allocating resources and investments under a prescriptive evaluation approach starting from the early planning stage. The research design can also be applied to determine the assessment system for other performance-based criteria in a green building assessment scheme. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Floresta G., Talotta C., Gaeta C., De Rosa M., Chiacchio U., Neri P., Rescifina A.\",\"\\xce\\xb3-Cyclodextrin as a Catalyst for the Synthesis of 2-Methyl-3,5-diarylisoxazolidines in Water\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019018378&doi=10.1021%2facs.joc.7b00227&partnerID=40&md5=273f193f187a51f73bafa1dd905ad71e\",\"A green and efficient 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of nitrones with different styrenes and cinnamates using a catalytic amount of \\xce\\xb3-cyclodextrin (\\xce\\xb3-CD) in water has been developed to give substituted isoxazolidines. \\xce\\xb3-CD was found to be highly efficacious in carrying out this reaction under an eco-friendly environment, affording moderate to excellent yields and, in some cases, excellent diastereomeric excess (up to >95%) at 100 \\xc2\\xb0C in 8-12 h.

Loss of smartphones not only causes economic loss but also jeopardizes the privacy of the owners. Existing anti-theft schemes only provide passive protection, which remotely manipulates lost phones to lock and delete private information. However, if the stealer deletes the protection apps or shuts down the phone before the owner being aware that the phone has been stolen, remedial actions become invalid. Hence it is of great importance to detect smartphone theft as soon as it happens, such that stealing can be stopped. In this paper, we propose SmartDog, a real-time smartphone anti-theft scheme for keeping smartphone safe. With embedded motion sensors, SmartDog can effectively capture the unique and reliable biometrical features of the owners about how they pick up the smartphone from their pockets or bags. If a stealer tries to steal a smartphone away from the pocket or bag of the owner, SmartDog will detect the unusual motion, even if an attacker can see an owner picking up his/her phone (Since the attacker can hardly reproduce the same behavior). We implement SmartDog and conduct intensive trace-driven simulations with \\'picking up\\' samples from 20 volunteers, collected over two weeks. SmartDog achieves 10.2% average false positive and 5.5% average false negative error rates, respectively. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 IEEE.\"\\n\"Cheng D., Wu M.\",\"A Novel Classifier - Weighted Features Cost-Sensitive SVM\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020188042&doi=10.1109%2fiThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.133&partnerID=40&md5=031d5185fa6ebf1650d653a378d374fc\",\"Learning effective and efficient classifiers for imbalanced data is one of ten challenge problems in data mining research. Studying classifiers for imbalanced data is a popular area in machine learning and data mining, which also has great significance in many areas, such as cancer diagnose, credit card fraud detection and intrusion detection. The study for imbalanced data classification can be divided into three major parts: resampling data, change internal algorithm and costsensitive learning. Weighted feature methods can also enhance the accuracy of classification. In this paper, we intend to use a novel method combining weighted feature and cost-sensitive learning to deal with imbalanced data. We add weights to features, which causes that the position of each instance in space changes. Our goal is to increase the separation between classes by enlarging the space around the separating boundary surface through weighted features. Since the margin is enlarged, the chance that the instances in minority class are classified into majority class by mistake will be lower. Weighted Features cost-sensitive SVM (WF-CSSVM) performs well in both accuracy and cost. UCI datasets are utilized in experiment part and most of them can be classified perfectly. Accuracy, G-mean and ROC are employed as evaluation metrics. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 IEEE.\"\\n\"Awadh O.\",\"Sustainability and green building rating systems: LEED, BREEAM, GSAS and Estidama critical analysis\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016462269&doi=10.1016%2fj.jobe.2017.03.010&partnerID=40&md5=422ad2f6825fd5bfa56f95945821b44a\",\"In the built environment, a green building rating system provides the project team a framework and a tool to help achieving a better sustainable development.

Achieving a green building certification does not necessarily mean that the building succeeded in achieving its environmental targets. The financial-driven and prescriptive implementation of GBRS are reasons behind a masked sustainability outcome. This paper presents an objective analysis between two internationally applied GBRSs; LEED and BREEAM, and two particularly developed for the gulf region; Estidama and GSAS.

It discusses the use of a multiple criteria decision making technique, namely the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), for developing the weights of the proposed rating system criteria, and generally reviews the use of AHP to develop building energy rating systems. While the AHP approach of criteria weighting was applied in other countries, the present study distinctively applied it to developing a proposed rating system for existing buildings in Egypt. In this study, nine energy rating criteria were identified by thoroughly comparing and analyzing internationally established green building / sustainability rating systems for existing buildings such as LEED, BREEAM, Green Globes, Energy Star, IGBC and Pearl rating system for Estidama. A survey was then conducted to collect the opinions of Egyptian engineering professionals regarding the relative priority of the identified criteria, and to determine, according to the opinions of participants, which criteria are mandatory and which are optional for existing buildings seeking to become \\xe2\\x80\\x98greener\\xe2\\x80\\x99. Using AHP, weights were developed for the optional criteria, representing their relative importance. Based on the performed analysis, the resulting rating criteria are: one mandatory prerequisite, which is the Minimum Energy Performance, and eight optional credits with descending relative weights, which are: Use of Renewable Energy Sources, Building Envelope Efficiency Strategies, Use of Energy Efficient Appliances and Equipment, Building Systems Automation and Controllability, Eco-friendly Refrigerants & Fire Suppression Systems, Operation and Maintenance Practices, Metering and Sub-metering of Building, zones and systems and finally Building-related Transportation Impact. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Guan R., Zheng H., Hu J., Fang Q., Ren R.\",\"The higher carbon intensity of loans, the higher non-performing loan ratio: The case of China\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018440688&doi=10.3390%2fsu9040667&partnerID=40&md5=5e2b68ef47dc77484e244e68ead12509\",\"In response to the call of the Chinese government to support low-carbon development, the issue has come to the view gradually as to whether the behaviors of banks\\' green credit will contribute to easing their own credit risk. To reflect the behaviors of green credit of banks in detail, an indicator, named the carbon intensity of loans (CIL), is first proposed in this paper to measure the carbon emissions with association of the loans for commercial banks, on basis of the series of the input-output table. Then, a panel data model is used to explore the relationship between CIL and non-performing loan ratio, which measures the credit risk of banks. Based on the data of China\\'s commercial banks from 2007 to 2014, an empirical study has been conducted to investigate the impacts of CIL upon the non-performing loan ratio from a microscopic-level perspective. The result indicates that CIL has a positive effect on the non-performing loan ratio of banks. Since CIL is considered a significant indicator for the banks\\' green credit, this paper comes to a conclusion that the green credit policy not only contributes to achieving of the emission-reduction targets for the society, but also promotes the development of banks\\' credit risk. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 by the authors.\"\\n\"Intriago R., Gortaire Am\\xc3\\xa9zcua R., Bravo E., O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Connell C.\",\"Agroecology in Ecuador: historical processes, achievements, and challenges\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018737900&doi=10.1080%2f21683565.2017.1284174&partnerID=40&md5=7a779917bc4dd3a97cf3eae3be0cbbfd\",\"Agroecology in Ecuador has developed from its early stages as a little known, incoherent response to the Green Revolution into a serious agrarian model, with key principles enshrined in the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Constitution and Food Sovereignty Law.

One under-studied component of the green infrastructure network is the urban forest system. Trees can play an important role as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfirst line of defense\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for restoring more natural hydrologic regimes in urban watersheds by intercepting rainfall, delaying runoff, infiltrating, and transpiring captured stormwater. However, inadequate research quantifying the urban tree contribution to rainfall/runoff processes limits their promotion by stormwater managers. The purpose of this literature review is to highlight the limited research performed, document areas of need for quantifying the benefits of urban trees for stormwater management, and provide a basis for providing credits for trees in stormwater designs. Recent research has shown that urban trees can retain a sizable volume of annual rainfall in their crowns, delay the flow of stormwater runoff, substantially increase the infiltration capacity of urban soils, and provide transpiration of sequestered runoff for additional stormwater storage. Tree canopy effectiveness is highest during short, low-intensity storms and lower as rainfall volume and intensity increases. While soils are the best medium to store and filter stormwater, trees may be integrated with other runoff reduction strategies to bring more natural hydrologic processes to urban watersheds by taking advantage of multiple points of retention. Gaps remain in the body of research, but there is a basis for considering trees an integral part of the watershed-scale green infrastructure network that helps reduce the volume and intensity of urban stormwater runoff.

This is usually identified as the triple bottom line of sustainability and is often represented by three intertwined circles. Therefore, for a construction to be sustainable, it should be environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable. However, the extent to which green building rating tools evaluate the three pillars of sustainability is questionable. This research aims to analyze the effectiveness of eight international green building rating tools in evaluating environmental, economic, and social sustainability in buildings. The credit points of each rating tool was initially categorized based on the related category of sustainability and a comparison analysis was carried out based on a normalized score. Finally, the comparison result is presented with a radar diagram. Further, three case study buildings were also analyzed based on the credit points achieved. Accordingly, environmental sustainability is widely considered in green building rating tools while economic sustainability is rarely evaluated. Further, social sustainability is evaluated in all the green building rating tools, which would approximately amount to 20% of the credit points allocated by each rating tool. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.\"\\n\"Jun M.A., Cheng J.C.P.\",\"Selection of target LEED credits based on project information and climatic factors using data mining techniques\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015739182&doi=10.1016%2fj.aei.2017.03.004&partnerID=40&md5=c5a36cf9557c28f092c4d049b898bb95\",\"Developed by the United States Green Building Council, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a credit-based rating system that provides third-party verification for green buildings.

In particular, we employ a five-step simulation modeling approach within a micro-economic model of crop production to assess the ability of yield monitors to promote liquefied petroleum (LP) gas savings and subsequently reduce production costs, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with LP gas burning, and generate additional revenue at a market for GHG mitigation credits. We estimate that the total benefits of using the green IS to improve the harvesting decision would have been $82 million in post-harvest cost savings and a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

Island spatiality encourages renewable energy and sustainability initiatives that emphasise iconicity and are undertaken in order to gain competitive advantage, strengthen sustainable tourism or ecotourism, claim undue credit, distract from failures of governance or obviate the need for more comprehensive policy action. Without necessarily contributing significantly to climate change mitigation, the pursuit of eco-island status can raise costs without raising income, distract from more pressing social and environmental problems, lead to competitive sustainability and provide green cover behind which communities can maintain unsustainable practices. We argue that eco-islands do not successfully encourage wider sustainable development and climate change mitigation. Instead, island communities may place themselves in eco-island traps. Islands may invest in inefficient or ineffective renewable energy and sustainability initiatives in order to maintain illusory eco-island status for the benefit of ecotourism, thereby becoming trapped by the eco-label. Islands may also chase the diminishing returns of ever-more comprehensive and difficult to achieve sustainability, becoming trapped into serving as eco-island exemplars. We conclude by arguing that island communities should pursue locally contextualised development, potentially focused on climate change adaptation, rather than focus on an eco-island status that is oriented toward place branding and ecotourism. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers)\"\\n\"Hamidian A., Sarshar Z., Stuart P.R.\",\"Technoeconomic analysis of continuous biodrying process in conjunction with gasification process at pulp and paper mills\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011343009&doi=10.1080%2f07373937.2016.1164182&partnerID=40&md5=b4f925ecf0e8417a82c3cf1f77ed37ea\",\"In the biorefinery context, thermochemical processes have attracted a significant attention in recent years. Such processes generally consist of three main steps: pretreatment, thermochemical treatment, and post-treatment. In these developing processes, drying and feeding of biomass feedstock remain a significant and costly challenge. The moisture content of biomass feedstock must be decreased to an economic level at pretreatment step otherwise it has to have a detrimental effect on the process efficiency and quality of products. This work addresses the drying of biomass feedstock using novel but practical technology, called biodrying. It is a green technology that offers an opportunity for biomass drying without using an external heat source or fossil fuels, since drying energy is generated through exothermic microbial activity in the biomass that enhances the drying rate. This paper focuses on technoeconomic assessment of continuous biodrying technology integrated to gasification-based biorefinery and investigates the conditions that make such novel technology viable in conjunction with gasification process. Fixed capital investment and operating cost of different biodrying scenarios were estimated as M$4.3\\xe2\\x80\\x9321 and M$0.85/y\\xe2\\x80\\x933.6/y, respectively, and potential benefits (sludge landfilling cost, energy savings, and carbon credit) from integration of the continuous biodrying system in gasification process implemented in pulp and paper mill were calculated, and ultimately economic performances of the scenarios were assessed. Furthermore, the viable biodrying conditions were specified as 4-day residence time and the major viability risk was found to be bound moisture of biomass. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 Taylor & Francis.\"\\n\"Wu P., Song Y., Shou W., Chi H., Chong H.-Y., Sutrisna M.\",\"A comprehensive analysis of the credits obtained by LEED 2009 certified green buildings\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991716834&doi=10.1016%2fj.rser.2016.10.007&partnerID=40&md5=6282354d921dedc70644c0be519014c8\",\"The concept of green building has gained rapid recognition recently. Developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is one of the most successful green building rating systems. Understanding the performance of LEED certified buildings on various LEED credits is therefore important for practitioners and regulatory authorities. This paper analyses the use of LEED 2009 and investigates the credit allocation pattern of 3416 LEED 2009 certified projects. The results show that compared to its previous version LEED v2.2, the point chasing problem in innovation related credits is mitigated. However, energy-related and material-related credits remain difficult for developers to obtain. LEED 2009 certified projects perform differently in water efficiency at the country level. At the state level, the projects perform differently in water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, material and resources, as well as indoor environmental quality. Varied credit achievement patterns are also identified on cross-certification and cross-sector levels. The study offers a useful guidance for practitioners to achieve relevant certification levels and for regulatory authorities to continuously improve the rating system. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Ramaswamy S., Schorsch C., Kolar M.\",\"Polymer Air-Conditioning Conveyance Lines for Automotive HVAC\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018685793&doi=10.4271%2f2017-26-0180&partnerID=40&md5=b13c88c60f1f6e298cbfc396f6f3caa9\",\"Automotive OEMs are adapting various \"\"green\"\" technologies to meet the upcoming and anticipated regulations for reducing direct and indirect GHG emissions equivalent to CO2. Using compact devices and lightweight components on the aggregates, OEMs get the benefit of carbon credits towards their contribution in reducing CO2 emissions. With regards to the HVAC systems, enhancements such as ultra-low permeation hose assemblies and adoption of low GWP refrigerant have shown promising results in reducing the direct GHG emissions by controlling refrigerant permeation & indirect GHG emissions by using compact and high efficiency compressors, compact heat exchangers, and other technologies that contribute to weight reduction and ultimately impact CO2 emissions. Traditional AC lines are routed/installed in space that accommodates the relative movement between the engine and chassis by connecting the various parts. Direct emissions from HVAC operating with R134a contribute nearly 25% of the equivalent CO2 emissions per vehicle[1]. By reducing the weight of AC lines by 20-30% through the use of polymers, these emissions can be reduced by as much as 50%[2]. Material selection is the key for the sustained performance of the AC lines over a period of time. Eaton has worked with its technology partners to identify polymer materials & with in-house expertise worked on the evaluation of different manufacturing methods to finalize the appropriate one suitable for industrialization. Successful field trials has justified the selection of material & manufacturing process. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 SAE International.\"\\n[No author name available],\"4th International Symposium and 26th National Conference on Operational Research, 2015\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125402635&partnerID=40&md5=ca121305227cb0498295079e5dd4704c\",\"The proceedings contain 14 papers.

However, few detailed studies have investigated whether green certification effectively leads to higher occupant satisfaction with the qualities of the indoor environment. Building on previous work, we analysed a subset of the Center for the Built Environment (CBE) Occupant Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) survey database - featuring 11,243 responses from 93 LEED-rated office buildings - to rigorously explore the relationships between the credits achieved by certified buildings in the IEQ category and the satisfaction expressed by occupants with their workspace and with related factors of indoor environmental quality. We found that the achievement of a specific IEQ credit did not increase occupant satisfaction. Qualitative assessments suggested that there are many reasons for this lack of relationships, many of which are outside the control of designers and beyond the scope of green building certification systems based primarily on design intent. We conclude with a summary of recommendations that design professionals, certification systems, and evaluation methods need to consider for moving us towards more comfortable, higher performing, and healthier green-certified buildings.

Although LEED is used internationally, it was initially developed by the U.S. Green Building Council as a tool to measure building performance in a modern American urban environment with temperate climate, a steady economy and easy access to technology. Furthermore, regionalization strategies such as Regional Priority Credits (RPCs) and Alternate Compliance Paths (ACPs), do not address the sociocultural reality of many regions. Therefore, the focus of this research is to analyse what indicators should be added, modified or substituted to develop a revised LEED model for the specific sociocultural context of P.R.? A mixed methods research will be used to compare LEED criteria with Sustainable Assessment Systems (SAS) such as the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method, the Living Building Challenge and SB Tool. Also, SAS in tropical countries such as Singapore (BCA Green Mark), Costa Rica (RESET) and India (TERI-GRIHA) will be examined. Case studies will be analysed with a main focus in Schools.

It is argued that urban environment causes the many difficulties that globe faces; global warming, ozone depletion, energy crisis, outdoor and indoor thermal discomfort, urban heat island ecological imbalance, and many other issues. Consequently, rating systems for green buildings and communities were one of the recently rising methods to assess how far they are friendly to their environments. In this concern, compact urban forms plays a role in ameliorating outdoor thermal conditions, saving energy consumption and mitigation of UHI where surfaces receive a great amount of solar radiation especially in hot arid regions. When constructing new developments, it is controllable to follow green rating credit details for neighbourhood and apply it, but with respect to already existing urban neighbourhoods, there are limited credit points to gain in order to upgrade the total accreditation. In this paper, four case studies for the same urban neighbourhood site in different climate change scenarios were numerically simulated to assess how urban trees lines, roof gardens, shading structure and albedo as adaptation methods can improve outdoor conditions, mitigate UHI and in turn increase energy efficiency. Initially, both cases were rated as non-green neighbourhoods, but adaptation methods used, upgraded the credit points gained and pushed the rating into the green zone.

While the environmental benefits are generally considered as business expenses, a new trend is to turn sustainable construction into profit. By generating financial revenue via carbon trading mechanism, asphalt producers and road builders can compensate their sustainable efforts and adoption of recycling techniques for reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. This carbon trading mechanism rewards emission reduction projects with carbon offsets that can be sold at a certain price in the market. This paper develops a framework for pavement recycling projects to verify GHG reductions and register for carbon offsets. Unlike most standards today that use a project-by-project method to quantify carbon offsets, a performance standard is presented based on the life cycle environmental impact analysis to facilitate credit assessment, generation, and verification. The results of thirteen pavement project cases demonstrate that, even with a 20% market share, cold recycling techniques will be able to achieve an emission reduction of 2.8 million tons of GHGs every year. If these GHG reductions can be quantified into carbon offsets for trading, cold recycling techniques will open up more than 20 million revenue sources beyond direct product sales. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.\"\\n\"Clements J., Sands R., Henderson J.\",\"Incentives for green infrastructure on private property: Lessons learned (Water research foundation project #4684)\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052080037&partnerID=40&md5=6b0e5e811e10da17b1980a975f89c0b0\",\"The objective of the project is to identify and understand lessons learned and best practices for green infrastructure incentive programs for private property owners including: stormwater fee discount/credits, grants, rebate/installation financing, development/redevelopment incentives, awards and recognition, and credit trading programs.

To meet the goals of their long-term control plan (LTCP), the Authority is required to reducetheir combined sewer overflow (CSO) events. The largest obstacle to stormwater control is the land resources available to allocate for stormwater storage in this highly developed urban area. The Authority realized the benefit of using innovative strategies to reduce the rate and quantity of flows entering into the combined sewer system during wet weather events. Ultimately, it was determined that many new development sites would require actively controlled stormwater systems. The Authority navigated through many iterations of its sewer connection requirements while addressing the challenges of their legal jurisdiction within private property. New maintenance requirements were developed in tandem with an online tool to be used by the sewer connection applicant for determining each applicant\\'s storm water detention volume and control requirements.

Between 1995 and 2014, 15,000 extreme weather events were recorded globally. In these extreme weather events, 525,000 people died, and losses were estimated to be more than 3.0 trillion USD. The impact of climate change (regular floods, droughts, and others) is influencing the ability of the society and built environment to operate as they would in usual circumstances. Therefore, along with the concept of self-reliance and resource independence, buildings need to be designed to be operational, functional, and secure while facing natural disasters. Facilities should possess the ability to absorb, adapt, recover quickly from the natural stresses, and be operational and functional. Thus, to design an effective climate resilient building it is important to understand the effectiveness of buildings certified under the current building rating systems (BRS) to address the aforementioned issues. Considering LEED as the most commonly adopted BRS within the nation, the goal of this study is to ascertain the resilience of LEED certified buildings. For this study, four LEED Certified Institutional Buildings within the state of Oklahoma were purposively selected based on the availability of building data, LEED version of the projects, and location for precise comparison. The buildings\\' achieved LEED credit data were further analyzed through content analysis method, to assess the resilience of the facilities towards natural disasters incurred within the state. Results indicated that although all four buildings have achieved a few LEED credits, which helps the buildings to be resilient against natural disasters like a tornado, they cannot be considered as resilient buildings due to the lack of optimum energy performance and onsite resource generation ability. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.\"\\n\"Black D., Vilas K., Magraw R.\",\"High risk process loops: A case study using fire hazard analysis to effectively manage fire escalation risk\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045759139&partnerID=40&md5=abc46cbe8ad72bddf57d6aa69271d15c\",\"The purpose of this paper is to introduce readers to the concept of high risk process loop risk reduction using a case study involving a novel approach to fire hazard analysis. Worldwide, industry standards and best practices require personnel risk to be calculated and reviewed for existing and new petrochemical facilities. One way of addressing personnel risk is via a thorough Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA), which identifies populations who may incur high risk as a result of working at the facility. Subsequent risk reduction may include relocation of personnel or providing better protection (i.e., new buildings or building upgrades). However, a QRA can also identify the \"\"high risk process loops\"\" (HRPLs), which are those areas of the process contributing the most risk to onsite and offsite personnel. A process loop is a portion of a process unit where, if a release were to occur, the predicted consequence would be similar. For example, one of the process loops for a debutanizer may include the column, reboiler loop, bottoms pump, and after cooler, with the release point conservatively taken at the high pressure discharge of the pump. Depending on the complexity, a single process unit may include around 50 process loops with only a handful identified as HRPLs. By addressing HRPLs identified in QRAs and other risk studies such as insurance loss reviews, environmental studies, and other consequence or risk based analyses, facility management can potentially drive risk down without moving people, erecting new buildings, upgrading existing buildings, or conducting other costly actions to reduce population exposure. The approach enables not only a risk reduction to onsite and offsite personnel, but also can reduce the risk of asset damage, environmental impact and business interruption. Risk reduction credit for HRPLs can be justified in a number of ways including demonstrating highly reliable and effective control systems, showing industry best practice Process Safety Management (PSM) programmes for those areas, and/or by performing specific safety studies that address the identified hazard. One example of such a safety study utilised to demonstrate risk reduction credit for thermal radiation impacts is a Fire Hazard and Mitigation Analysis (FHMA). FHMA is an analysis that can be performed for both existing and green field facilities with the intent to review design basis fire scenarios for each HRPL to aid identification of fire protection measures. Once design basis fire scenarios are defined, the FHA reviews both passive and active fire protection systems and emergency response arrangements to identify locations in which knock-on effects pose a high risk. The case study involves propylene presenting a high thermal risk to indoor and outdoor onsite personnel. The FHMA methodology utilised combines quantitative calculations for thermal radiation, passive protection gaps, and water coverage with a qualitative review of fire protection systems and emergency response. The result is an integrated plan for reducing risk to personnel and assets as well as addressing areas at risk of escalation. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 IChemE.\"\\n\"Odeku K.O.\",\"The intrinsic role of the banks in decarbonizing the economy\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042790002&doi=10.21511%2fbbs.12%284%29.2017.04&partnerID=40&md5=2e80fb94201b34b538ee41c5d019cdc6\",\"Global warming and climate change continue to disrupt the environment and all aspects of people\\'s endeavors and as such, there is need to look at causes of climate change and deploy appropriate tools to address the problem of the scourge of climate change.

Through the DMAIC process, the team conducted detailed analysis of the available data, identified several areas for improvement, and implemented controls and procedures to get the process in control and reduce the number of defects in turn-in documentation. The results of the effort were profound and reduced the processing time by over 50% and improved the sigma quality level from 0.5 to 2.4. Additionally, the teams recommended changes to the GPC process are being adopted across the Academy to decrease processing time and improve quality associated with this administrative process. This paper provides an overview of the process and its application to the excessive time and effort required to approve simple purchases with a government credit card as a case study for a successful implementation of the Army\\'s LSS process. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 American Society for Engineering Management.\"\\n\"Sadatsafavi H., Shepley M., Kim A., Huynh H.\",\"How do green healthcare facilities perform financially when compared to non-green hospitals overtime?

A roadmap is presented to overcome these challenges as well as transform landfill operations to green energy initiatives. A feasibility study including financial analysis was performed for electric energy production from the captured landfill gas, solar-electric energy from closed landfill cells, and bioenergy from buffer and idle lands bordering the landfilling areas. While the landfill- and solar-electric energy options are economically viable, the bioenergy option requires due consideration of production capacity and tax credit and incentives. Returns on investment can provide sustainable solid-waste tipping fees, offset funding required for post-closure expenses, and reduce GHG emissions without direct land-use change. Energy policies for carbon credits and tax incentives are critical elements to sustain the financing of green energy projects for the waste management industry. \\xc2\\xa9 2017, Econjournals.

Design/methodology/approach: The study examined reports and websites of Chinese banks, categorized different corporate sustainability aspects and conducted panel regression and Granger causality to analyze cause and effect variables. Findings: The environmental and social performance of Chinese banks increased significantly between 2009 and 2013. Furthermore, a bi-directional causality between financial performance and sustainability performance of Chinese banks has been found. Based on institutional theory, this interaction may be influenced by the Chinese Green Credit Policy. Research limitations/implications: The findings suggest that corporate sustainability performance and financial performance are not a trade-off but correlate positively. Further research is needed to analyze the effect of financial regulations, such as the Chinese Green Credit Policy. Practical implications: According to the good management theory by Waddock and Graves (1997) that claims a positive impact of corporate social performance on financial performance, Chinese banks can invest in corporate sustainability to increase their financial success and re-invest parts of the additional returns \\xe2\\x80\\x93 also called slack resources \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in sustainability activities.

Through nearly two decades of LEED building development, comparative studies of LEED strategies among buildings are not rare, but still in demand due to the lessons learned from other LEED certified buildings. This paper presents case studies on the green building strategies utilized for six student recreational facilities certified by the U.S. Green Building Council\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating system and examines favorable strategies that lead to the success of obtaining higher rating levels. The comparative analysis results showed that the energy and atmosphere and indoor environmental quality categories that utilized energy performance optimization and innovative architectural designs for better daylights and views were major components for higher rating levels apart from conventional design criteria such as location, climate, and density. The recreational facilities having higher ratings were more favorable in obtaining credits using central plants, stormwater design, innovative wastewater technologies, and light control. The findings not only provide specific green buildings strategies for student recreational facilities, but they also enhance the green initiatives for future education facilities on university campuses. \\xc2\\xa9 2017, College Publishing.

This case study explores the collaborative design process that resulted in a high performing building for waste and recycling at Brookfield Place Perth, a 5 Star Green Star development. A number of key factors that contributed to successful outcomes are discussed. These include the use of the Green Star Office Mat-1 credit for recycling space which set clear baseline parameters; the positive role of the client who, as owner, developer and operator of the building, was committed to ensuring that it is operationally effective; the role of architects who sought to avoid the waste management errors commonly found in other commercial buildings that could result in inefficient or unsafe operations; and the role of specialist waste consultants engaged early in the project and as needed throughout the development of the design so that adequate storage and vehicle access could be accommodated within the design of the main loading dock level. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\"\\n\"Maltese S., Tagliabue L.C., Cecconi F.R., Pasini D., Manfren M., Ciribini A.L.C.\",\"Sustainability Assessment through Green BIM for Environmental, Social and Economic Efficiency\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020816995&doi=10.1016%2fj.proeng.2017.04.211&partnerID=40&md5=7ed4699b3302628e474ecd280d70ed61\",\"BIM is representing a shift in the traditional process of building delivery.

Meanwhile, BIM is widely diffused in UK and Northern Europe, as it includes a more accurate documentation, less rework and shorter project timelines. The use of BIM to provide data for energy performance evaluation and sustainability assessment is defined Green BIM and pioneering design organizations are adopting this approach to enable integrated design, construction and maintenance towards Net Zero Energy buildings. Green BIM includes Building Energy Modelling dealing with project energy performance to identify options optimising building energy efficiency during the life cycle.

The current version of BEAM Plus v1.2 has introduced the passive design concept to make the rating scheme in line with the state-of-art energy efficient design in the world. However, the introduced passive design approach is criticized for its arguable criteria allocation, unjustified weighting system and incompatibility with the existing whole building energy simulation approach. In view of these flaws, a new weighting system based on different global sensitivity analysis methods, robust energy end-use statistics and a green building case study is proposed in this article. The total available credits of sub-criteria are determined according to the ratio of the cooling and lighting energy consumption in the total end-use energy data of residential buildings. Eventually, the priorities of assessment criteria are derived from the sensitivity analysis of a generic building model based on a simultaneous variation of different design parameters. The results from this research can help stakeholders in a green building project to identify design strategies with the largest impact over building performance and obtain an optimized preliminary design in the early planning stage. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 The Authors.\"\\n\"Cherian J., Jacob J., Farouk S.\",\"A review on carbon trading: New age enterprise for sustainable development and profitability with special reference to UAE\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019744379&doi=10.1504%2fWRSTSD.2017.084172&partnerID=40&md5=d88fb1b00825e4cc54e3d2a0ee5669bb\",\"This study is an attempt to analyse carbon emission trading with a special focus on United Arab Emirates.

STARS is an example of a second-generation \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rating system focused on transportation planning, design, operations and maintenance. Design/methodology/approach: In Fall 2013, James Madison University (JMU) initiated a STARS pilot demonstration using a local corridor that connects the university and the city of Harrisonburg. The pilot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s purposes were to develop attainable transportation-development targets, evaluate infrastructure and programmatic options in the context of a credit-based system and demonstrate a decision-making framework centered on sustainability optimization. The paper provides an overview of the STARS framework and the pilot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s collaborations, analysis, findings and recommendations for credits across sustainability dimensions. Findings: Upon applying the rating system, the research team found that STARS may initially be easier to integrate into a comprehensive transportation planning process than a corridor-level evaluation due to data needs, in-house expertise and planning timelines for campus and city developments. A campus-wide master plan based on STARS would enable a university and a city to apply sustainability principles to their physical and/or policy interfaces to systemically create change and achieve quantifiable targets. Originality/value: The STARS framework provides a novel approach for integrating multiple stakeholders (faculty, the university and city staff, students and community members) in a process of capacity building, evaluating options, policy-making, implementation and performance monitoring. The JMU pilot is the first application of STARS at a university and the only US East Coast application to date. \\xc2\\xa9 2017, \\xc2\\xa9 Emerald Publishing Limited.\"\\n\"Jung H., Moon S.\",\"Matching level and investors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 heterogeneous beliefs\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018330308&doi=10.19030%2fjabr.v33i3.9936&partnerID=40&md5=aaa3b546a17f3f80c108198e249d45d6\",\"This study investigated the relation between matching level and investors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 heterogeneous beliefs using listed firm (KOSPI) data in Korea. This study is based on prior research that reported that the higher the matching level, the less the noise included in accounting earnings and the higher the earnings quality. Karpoff (1986), Bamber (1987), Ajinkya, Atiase, &amp; Gift (1991) and Dormeier (2011) explain that if there are different interpretations among investors regarding intrinsic value of a company, as a result, the trading volume can represent investors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 heterogeneous beliefs. Whereas the previous studies on matching level analyzed what kind of impact matching level improvement has on earnings quality, accumulated market adjusted return, foreign ownership, future earnings response coefficient (FERC) and bond credit rating. However, these studies have problems in measuring the matching level. So this study suggested additional proxy on matching level in addition to the proxy used in previous studies. Specifically, we analyzed the matching level model of Paek\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (2011b) by using the Prais-Winsten estimation method and then used the calculated explanatory power (Adj.R2) as a proxy for the additional matching level. To empirically analyze hypothesis of this study, we used firm-year observation from 4,094 firms listed on Korean Stock Exchange over the period from 2003 to 2011. We found that matching level regression coefficient consistently showed significantly negative values for each measurement. Moreover, we analyzed additionally by measuring the calculated regression coefficient (\\xce\\xb22) of current expenses as matching level response coefficient after analyzing Dichev and Tang\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (2008) matching level measuring model by Prais-Winsten estimation method. It showed that regression coefficient of the current expenses and trading volume have negative correlation. This is consistent with this study, and it can be analyzed that as matching level improves, investors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 heterogeneous beliefs decrease. According to microeconomics theory of Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green (1995), trading volume is explained to affect price changes. However, accounting and related studies analyze the information effect by using price change only. In this sense, this study is meaningful in that it conducted an analysis on the information effect of matching level through trading volume. In addition, this study contributes to understand the microscopic structure of the capital market. \\xc2\\xa9 by author(s).\"\\n\"Brotman B.A.\",\"The impact of corporate tax policy on sustainable retrofits\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016764119&doi=10.1108%2fJCRE-02-2016-0011&partnerID=40&md5=f161bf11dd39e4113ff828cbca3cbf97\",\"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to ascertain whether energy retrofits need to be directed by public policy intervention or can be encouraged through tax relief that harnesses profit incentives. Existing office space potentially has an economic life of 25 to 40 years. It may be operating inefficiently compared to newer buildings for many years. Designing a market-based incentive system that encourages periodic remodeling which lowers energy usage and carbon emissions would have social benefits. Design/methodology/approach: An owner/user case study is developed to test financial feasibility. The empirical study uses publicly available information to examine whether the variables modeled react as anticipated. The regression model incorporates variables of importance to an owner/user. Tax credits and energy deductions, interest rates associated with borrowing and likely electricity and natural gas rate changes are independent variables used to predict the dependent variable new non-residential private construction spending. Findings: Investment tax credits (ITCs) coupled with lending has a positive impact on new non-residential commercial construction spending. The value of these benefits is not sufficient to encourage total building energy retrofits, but would encourage low-cost system upgrades. The interest rates associated with borrowing and the debt-service coverage ratio need to be kept low for existing building energy retrofits to be stimulated. Practical implications: The case study provides a template that a business can use to determine the financial feasibility of a proposed energy upgrade. It enables the comparison of the marginal cost associated with an update to the present value of the financial benefits likely to be generated. Local real estate tax reductions linked to specific energy upgrades offered by many municipalities can be added to the expected energy savings generated by doing the retrofit. Social implications: Tax systems designed to solve environmental pollution problems do not require regulators, inspections or court case decisions and are inherently less intrusive to businesses. Coupling private financial incentives with public policy goals cause energy-saving technologies to be adopted more quickly and with less public outcry. Originality/value: The paper specifically considers the factors that influence an owner/user of the property. Rental rates and vacancy losses do not influence a property owner/user. Prior studies looked at revenue enhancements and lower-vacancy rates possibly associated with a green compared to a non-green office building. These studies did not focus on the owner/user paradigm. They reported financial benefits accruing to property owners who lease the office building. Many retrofit studies tended to use CoStar Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s data, which are collected by a for-profit company and sold to users.

This study investigates the environmental performance of EP members and non-members, in terms of financing projects with extreme adverse environmental impact. Based on literature about voluntary programs, I suggest that the institutional design of the EP lacks some important elements that are associated with better performance. Therefore it is hypothesised that EP membership will not lead to improvements in environmental performance. The results show that EP members are not involved in fewer hazardous projects than non-EP members. Also, a comparison between the activities of EP members before and after their adoption of the EP shows that they financed more hazardous projects after they adopted the EP.

Therefore, it is important to decrease the costs of such projects during their life cycle, taking into consideration the available resources. This paper focuses on two aspects of the sustainability of building through its life cycle; environmental and economic. For this purpose, the methodology considers reasonable costs that fit LIH projects using environmentally friendly materials. The methodology is based on assessing the LCC of LIH projects, taking into consideration initial cost and operation costs. The paper focuses on green-building materials with minimal cost, corresponding to the maximum number of points awarded under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system.

The proposed assessment methodology helps the decision makers in governmental housing authorities to modify the current management policies for improving the current situation of LIH. In addition, it aids government and/or contractors to minimize LCC while achieving maximum LEED material credit points for LIH projects. A detailed case study in Egypt is presented to clarify the practical features of the proposed model. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 Elsevier B.V.\"\\n\"Wang L., Zhu Y.\",\"Green credit policy and the maturity of corporate debt\",2017,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84984918703&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-10-1837-4_138&partnerID=40&md5=dc7f6415497d488deb625a4059345854\",\"This paper is based on strict credit environment under the background of green credit policy in China. It focuses on the change in the maturity of corporate debt of polluted enterprises. The research finds that long-term loan of polluted enterprises is significantly dropped after the policy. Extensive research shows that after green credit policy, long-term loan of state-owned polluted enterprises is higher than private polluted enterprises. The result shows that under hash green credit environment, banks are more cautious about loans to polluted enterprises. In terms of the maturity of corporate debt, polluted enterprises are subject to severe constraints in general. However, state-owned polluted enterprises face fewer restrictions due to credit discrimination. Generally, green credit policy has achieved some success and it provides institution guarantee for sustainable economic development in China. \\xc2\\xa9 Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.\"\\n\"Delimatsis P.\",\"Research handbook on climate change and trade law\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076283260&doi=10.4337%2f9781783478446&partnerID=40&md5=51b4355d5ce6d53cca0fac2535576a77\",\"The interaction between climate change and trade has grown in prominence in recent years.

Landfill gas, composed of approximately equal proportions of methane and carbon dioxide, is acknowledged as a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Methane is one of the short-lived climate pollutants requiring urgent action to mitigate. However, landfill gas also represents a potential source of \\'green\\' power where it is extracted and combusted in a power generation facility. Landfill gas-to- energy projects therefore have the potential for a dual contribution to greenhouse gas reduction through mitigation of methane emissions and avoidance of fossil-fuel power. In addition, landfill gas extraction and combustion represents a key component of sustainable landfill management practices, essential for reducing the risk of gas migration and associated human and environmental impacts. Given the available and proven technology, and the cross-benefits of improved landfill gas management, landfill gas-to- energy could be viewed as a \\'low hanging fruit\\' for greenhouse gas mitigation. However, despite widespread adoption of landfill gas-to- energy projects in Northern European countries, North America, and metropolitan Australia and New Zealand, the majority of landfilled waste at the global level is not subject to gas capture and extraction systems. Barriers to growth in projects include technical limitations in some poorer regions, but are primarily due to weak regulatory environments and lack of financial incentives. Historically, the major drivers for development of landfill gas-to- energy projects have been regulatory requirements and revenue generated through a combination of power sales, carbon credits and/or renewable energy certificates. At both the international and national level, uncertainty in policies governing carbon and renewable energy markets, and the consequent market instability, have compromised the growth of investment in landfill gas to energy. \\xc2\\xa9 The Editors and Contributors Severally 2016.\"\\n\"Nehring R.\",\"Yield of dreams: Marching west and the politics of scientific knowledge in the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa)\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006851432&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoforum.2016.11.006&partnerID=40&md5=d050c1bb8ad8780904ceb96c99fb5606\",\"Over the past forty years, Brazilian agriculture has rapidly industrialized elevating the country as the world\\'s first tropical agricultural giant. Much of the credit for this transformation has gone to the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) for their work in the center-west region of the country. This area, known as the Cerrado, industrialized rapidly starting in the early 1970s with the introduction of chemical fertilizers to fix its acidic soils and the development of new seed varieties adapted to the tropics. This paper historicizes the political and social relations behind the industrial transformation of the Cerrado by focusing on the establishment of Embrapa. I argue that US political relations and corporate interests helped to lay the scientific and institutional groundwork for public research in Brazil to ensure long-term industrialization of the Cerrado. The case of Embrapa, and their work in the Cerrado, expands the geographical, political and economic understanding of the deployment of US scientific experts and expertise during the Green Revolution.

The industry is inherently inclusive supporting over 6 million farmers and their families, along with workers and entrepreneurs of over 550 sugar mills, apart from a host of wholesalers and distributors spread across the country. Contribution of sugarcane to the national GDP is 1.1% which is significant considering that the crop is grown only in 2.57% of the gross cropped area. In India sugar is an essential item of mass consumption, and the domestic demand is around 25 million tonnes per annum. Sugar and jaggery are the cheapest source of energy, supplying around 10% of the daily calorie intake. Sugarcane has been projected as the crop for the future, contributing to the production of not only sugar but also a renewable source of green energy in the form of bioethanol, bioelectricity and many biobased products. The industry produces 350\\xe2\\x80\\x93365 million tons (Mt) cane, 25\\xe2\\x80\\x9327\\xc2\\xa0Mt white sugar and 6\\xe2\\x80\\x938\\xc2\\xa0Mt jaggery and khandsari every year. Besides, about 2.7 billion litres of alcohol and 5500\\xc2\\xa0MW of power and many chemicals are also produced. The industry is able to export around 3200\\xc2\\xa0MW of power to the grid. The major challenges for sugarcane agriculture is static sugarcane productivity (70\\xc2\\xa0tons/ha) and sugar recovery (10%) at national level. The Indian sugar industry is fully capable of meeting demand of potable alcohol as well as 5% blending in gasoline. Industry is gradually transforming into sugar complexes by producing sugar, bioelectricity, bioethanol, biomanure and chemicals. Emergent businesses like fuel ethanol, raw sugar and structural changes in global market have provided new horizons for the Indian sugar industry. The sector today not only has transformational opportunities that would enable it to continue to service the largest domestic markets but has also emerged as a significant carbon credit and green power producer and has potential to support ethanol blending programme of E10 and beyond. The sugar industry is gearing up to meet the challenges of 2030 through judicious integration of agro-technology, improved management practices, diversification and farmers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 friendly policies. The crop besides providing the food and energy needs of the country also contributes to employment and revenue generation, social development and environmental safety. Because of the manifold benefits from the crop and its wide and varied uses, sugarcane agriculture will remain a major contributor to the sustainable development of sugar industry in India. \\xc2\\xa9 2016, Society for Sugar Research & Promotion.\"\\n\"Meyer I., Van Niekerk J.L.\",\"Towards a practical resource assessment of the extractable energy in the Agulhas ocean current\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84973167229&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijome.2016.05.010&partnerID=40&md5=49f3cde865aeb68986d9bdcf7ff2ece8\",\"In a found region of energetic flow in the Agulhas Current, two locations are analysed. It is found that the current core borders on the mid-shelf (91 m depth) location and off-shore (255 m depth) location lies within its predominant path, with mean velocities of 1.34 m/s and 1.59 m/s respectively at a 30 m depth. In the period analysed only one large meander is noted at a depth of 30 m. The percentage current reversals are 4.1% and 3.1% at the mid-self and off-shore locations, respectively. The most suited developed technology found to potentially deploy in this current is Minesto Deep Green turbine. The found capacity factor and specific yield for one Minesto (DG-12) 500 kW turbine at 30 m depth is estimated to be 62% with (4886 kWh/year)/kW for the mid-shelf location and 76% with 5416 (kWh/year)/kW for the off-shore location. Through a simplified analysis, the capacity credit of a possible 2000 MW array is analysed. It is found that an ocean current power plant can add to the load carrying capacity of the country and outperforms onshore wind power plants in this respect. The largest barriers at present are the cost and mooring challenges which presents a need for a detailed economic assessment to determine if associated costs of working in deeper waters (off-shore site) are justified. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

CDM projects have been developed in several parts of the world across the sectoral economies, including renewable energy, with reportedly varying degrees of success and failures. In the renewable energy segment, CDM has been successfully deployed in Micro-Hydel power projects to mitigate and offset green-house gas emissions into the environment. The experiences of different implementing states are vastly different in past decade. CDM applications in Micro-Hydel projects have been quite notable to generate hydro-power and mitigate emissions in the state. This paper takes a holistic review about the current status in the performance of CDM projects in India, with special reference to Himachal Pradesh, particularly in the context of Small (Micro)-Hydel projects with a very high renewable energy potential. The achievements as well as strategy of implementation of Small-Hydel projects in Himachal Pradesh is discussed in the light of selected case studies of CDM projects that are at various stages of formulation, designing and implementation. Guidelines for CDM project designing and the potential for carbon markets for the hydro-power in the context of Himachal Pradesh is discussed. Some of the shortcomings in implementation of Micro-Hydel CDM project in the State are also discussed and highlighted in the paper. The paper has also examined the status of implementation and the quality of projects in the form of illustrative case studies in terms of their ability for energy extraction, creating energy trading opportunities, and stakeholder participation in sharing the project benefits during the lifetime as well as the beyond the life-time of the projects. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 by IGI Global.

Both its monarchs and ministers shared a discourse of authority that postulated the throne as the only legitimate source of authority, which was not openly challenged by organized blocs of aristocratic, religious, or urban elites. Yet, the Northern Song Empire was much less autocratic in practice than in theory, since monarchs chose to delegate the making of state policy and the civil and military administration of the empire to a hierarchy of central, regional, and local officials, so that intra-bureaucratic dynamics limited arbitrary monarchical action. Using a micro-level case study of the abolition of the Green Sprouts rural credit policy (qingmiao fa \\xe2\\x80\\xa2) in 1085-1086, this article analyzes the debates within the Northern Song imperial bureaucracy about the reach of state power. The court\\'s anti-reformist high officials were united in their opposition to the policy, and individual ministers used a court-centered discourse of authority to denounce it for undermining the public good of the polity. Yet, its abolition required mobilizing extensive bureaucratic support within the central government and in local administration. By paying closer attention to the contexts and generic constraints of political rhetoric, and the intricacies of bureaucratic dynamics, it is possible to demonstrate more subtle fluctuations within the force fields of socio-political authority at court and in the country. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 SAGE Publications.\"\\n\"Shethji P.\",\"Credit checks under title VII: Learning from the criminal background check context\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84994291486&partnerID=40&md5=5b71db2c7a18261f8c43f47e81995175\",\"Nearly half of all employers consider applicants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 credit histories when making some hiring or promotion decisions\\xe2\\x80\\x94and they risk violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII) when they do so.

These tools, which utilise qualitative, credit-based rating system have several limitations. Firstly, they can only provide a relative measure of the greenness of a facility. Secondly, there is the possibility that the ratings assigned may differ from one user to another depending on the needs and priorities of an organisation, a country, or a region. Several studies have also highlighted that such credit-based systems involve piece-meal (Zuo and Zhou in Renew Sustain Energy Rev 30:271\\xe2\\x80\\x93281, 2014), as opposed to integrated evaluation of the green criteria, and the greenness of a facility. This paper proposes a new Green Index (GI) as a tool for assessing the level of greenness of a facility that overcomes the aforementioned limitations. The use of stock market composite index as a basis for the GI development has enabled an established tool for assessing stock market performances to progress into the domain of industrial and commercial facility management. Development of the GI involves two steps, namely the development of a weighting scheme using the factor analysis approach, followed by the composite GI formulation that is based on the stock market composite index. The developed Green Index is based on quantitative analysis and measurement of parameters, and hence, reflect the actual measure of the overall impact of a facility on the environment. With only a single indicator to represent multiple green elements, it makes it easier for facility managers to effectively and quantitatively monitor, analyse, compare and benchmark the actual level of greenness of facilities in new systems designs or a retrofit or conservation programme. \\xc2\\xa9 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\"\\n\"Sallam I., Abdelaal M.R.M.\",\"Relative weight of water efficiency credits: as an indicator to enhance buildings\\xe2\\x80\\x99 environmental assessment tools performance\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84948143582&doi=10.1080%2f00038628.2015.1107526&partnerID=40&md5=9afb6b18c9689e6c3ef1dfce464ba99e\",\"To assess buildings\\' environmental performance, many governments, associations and organizations have adopted what is generally known as environmental assessment tools to achieve this assess.

But still, the scientific knowledge and tools for identifying critical features that make a corridor efficient for biodiversity conservation, and for guiding their establishment and management are still scarce. Here, we define three types of indicator species based on their ecological requirements and dispersal traits in the context of forest metacommunities embedded into agricultural landscapes in N France. We then evaluate whether hedgerows can act as corridors for forest herb species and if this can be predicted from the occurrence of the selected indicator species. We show that among each socio-ecological group of forest herb species, (i) the best disperser (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cscout\\xe2\\x80\\x9d species) indicates habitat suitability for the other species of the group, hence predicts a colonization credit; (ii) the species with intermediate dispersal traits (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmedian\\xe2\\x80\\x9d species) indicates forest species richness and composition of a given hedgerow. In contrast, the worst dispersers (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfocal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d species) have a low indicator power, as a probable consequence of extinction events occurring in hedgerows, where ecological conditions are suboptimal with respect of forest species. The quality of the corridor increases with the width, height and age of hedgerows, but decreases with increasing land use intensity in adjacent lands. We conclude that process-based indicator species can be valuable tools to assess the efficiency of ecological corridors in fragmented landscapes. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Wang H., Wang F., Sun R., Gao C., Wang Y., Sun N., Wang L., Bi Y.\",\"Policies and regulations of crop straw utilization of foreign countries and its experience and inspiration for China\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84982995115&doi=10.11975%2fj.issn.1002-6819.2016.16.030&partnerID=40&md5=33781283ee6f051152e5101a92e3bc8b\",\"The developed countries have already marched a long way and accumulated rich experience in utilizing crop straw, which is fairly ahead of China particularly in the fields of the administrative policies and regulations.

The results show that crop straw in developed countries gives priority to recycle as fertilizer to the field, which plays an important role in forming reasonable fertilization structure. And major developed countries have established mature and efficient system of straw collection, storage and transportation, which is the key issue to develop crop straw utilization industry. In order to make full use of crop straw and reduce open burning, many developed countries have carried out some pertinent policies and regulations. Policies of straw utilization in foreign countries mainly focus on target strategy, government investment and financial support, tax incentives and concessional loans, as well as incentive mechanism. The main 2 types of laws and regulations on crop straw utilization in foreign countries are agriculture-type regulation and energy-type regulation. The former type mainly involves the regulations on tillage conservation and soil fertilization by crop straw returning. The latter one involves the regulations on renewable energy and biomass energy. The crop straw in China has the characteristics of large quantity, scattered distribution, and so on. Policies and regulations of crop straw utilization and management should be made according to the reality in China. Based on the advanced experiences in foreign countries, the recommended policies and regulations on how to improve straw utilization in China are proposed as follows: 1) Clarify targets and dominant modes of crop straw utilization; the goals of straw utilization will be broken into achievable goals, projects and actions in different years and areas, and straw returning is recommended to establish the fertilization system in China which also includes stable manure and chemical fertilizer; 2) Bring government\\'s function into full play to improve investment supporting in order to provide various financial supports, and the main measures are as follows: supports on technology equipment development and industrialization demonstration project, financial subsidy of green products, purchase allowance on agricultural machinery, and subsidies of mechanization of straw returning based on working area; 3) Make and implement tax, and credit and loan preference polices on straw processing and utilization of enterprises, as well as straw collection and transportation companies, carry out investment tax compensation and deduction of value added tax (VAT) policy on straw utilization projects, and formulate and implement different carbon tax policies, such as laying high carbon tax on fossil energy but free carbon tax on biomass energy; 4) Establish policy incentive mechanism by improving the incentives for investing, such as building fund-raising system including central and local government and management body, and implementing rural electricity price on straw collection, storage and processing, and reduction and exemption policy on road and bridge toll; 5) Formulate and promulgate laws and regulations of straw utilization and set up relatively mature law system; amend laws about crop straw utilization, for example, add regulations of raising animal with crop straw to Animal Husbandry Law, and add relevant regulations of conservation tillage to Soil and Water Conservation Law, and establish regulations on crop straw collection-storage system and \"\"5F\"\" (fertilizer, fuel, fodder, fiber, feed stock) utilization. Requirement and relevant standards of straw comprehensive utilization and safe handling should be clarified in regulation of new countryside and beautiful countryside construction. \\xc2\\xa9 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

However, the perceived clash of economic values versus environmental norms in Islam deservesmore careful examination. This brief article considers the advent of the \"\"Islamic Declaration on Climate Change\"\"whichwas promulgated in 2015 and considers the tangible steps Muslim government leaders and civil society have taken on this matter. The tangible steps that are being considered with an action plan are discussed in the light of earlier environmental movements within Islam. A brief discussion of environmental norms within Islamic scriptures is also provided to give theological context to this narrative. The establishment of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in the UAE as a treaty-based organizationwithUnitedNations affiliations is also considered. The environment can play an important peace-building role in the region as exemplified by organizations such as Eco-peace in Palestine, Israel, and Jordan. Based on the analysis of these developments, it is likely that Muslim countries will continue to play a more proactive role in addressing climate change than they are often given credit for in popular discourse. \\xc2\\xa9 Middle East Studies Association 2017.\"\\n\"Shaw K., Irfan M., Shankar R., Yadav S.S.\",\"Low carbon chance constrained supply chain network design problem: a Benders decomposition based approach\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978153315&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2016.06.011&partnerID=40&md5=a9a3f0aaf60e33f431e76eaff74f11b7\",\"This paper proposes a chance constrained based green supply chain network design model addressing carbon emissions and carbon trading issues. The model determines the optimal flow of materials as well as emissions across the supply chain network. The basic model has been further extended into two models addressing different carbon emission issues.

This study applies Benders decomposition algorithm to handle chance constrained sustainable supply chain network design problem. The proposed models are illustrated with suitable examples and results are carefully analyzed and discussed. The results demonstrated that the flow of materials across the supply chain network varies with the change of the probability as well as carbon credit price. The number of openings of the plants is also influenced with the change of carbon credit price. Similarly, variable cost and variable emissions have been found increased and decreased, respectively with the increase of carbon credit price for the base model. The model is also equipped with dissimilar carbon prices for handling cap and trade scenario. This paper may help managers to deal uncertainties as well as managing emissions of a supply chain network. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Azzolina N.A., Peck W.D., Hamling J.A., Gorecki C.D., Ayash S.C., Doll T.E., Nakles D.V., Melzer L.S.\",\"How green is my oil?

This work builds upon previous investigations and integrates new information to provide more plausible ranges for CO2 storage in the reservoir during CO2-EOR. The system model includes three segments: upstream, gate-to-gate, and downstream processes. Our base case model using Ryan-Holmes gas separation technology for the CO2-EOR site determined the emissions from upstream, gate-to-gate, and downstream processes to be 117, 98, and 470 kg CO2e/bbl (CO2 equivalents per barrel of incremental oil produced), respectively, for total emissions of 685 kg CO2e/bbl. However, these emissions are offset by CO2 storage in the reservoir and the resulting displacement credit of U.S. grid electricity, which results in a net life cycle emission factor of 438 kg CO2e/bbl. Therefore, CO2-EOR produces oil with a lower emission factor than conventional oil (~500 kg CO2e/bbl). Optimization scenarios are presented that define a performance envelope based on the CO2 capture rate and net CO2 utilization and suggest that lower emission factors below 300 kg CO2e/bbl are achievable. Based on these results, CO2-EOR where the CO2 is sourced from a coal-fired power plant provides one potential means for addressing the energy demand-climate change conundrum, by simultaneously producing electricity and oil to meet growing energy demand and reducing GHG emissions to abate global warming. \\xc2\\xa9 2016.\"\\n\"Aarthi D., Indira N.\",\"Enabling efficient and protected sharing of data in cloud computing\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84992013274&doi=10.1109%2fICICES.2016.7518876&partnerID=40&md5=a10d797ae21ac8930e334d2e33caf96e\",\"Cloud storage plays a vital role especially in applications such as medical files transfer and green computing where in-house data storage systems are established. In case of group-shared data, the data face both cloud-specific and conventional insider threats. Secure data sharing among a group that counters insider threats of legitimate yet malicious users is an important research issue in cloud. Protected Sharing of data in cloud should maintain: data confidentiality and integrity; access control; data sharing (forwarding) without using compute-intensive re-encryption; insider threat security; and forward and backward access control. The PrSDC methodology encrypts a file with a single encryption key. Two different key shares for each of the users are generated, with the user only getting one share. The possession of a single share of a key allows the PrSDC methodology to counter the insider threats and prevents stealing of medical files or in case of green computing online credit payment details. The other key share is stored by a trusted third party, which is called the cryptographic server. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 IEEE.\"\\n\"Afshari H., Issa M.H., Radwan A.\",\"Using failure mode and effects analysis to evaluate barriers to the greening of existing buildings using the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating system\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84979725657&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2016.03.140&partnerID=40&md5=178d43c10e6ad8d2aafe3ab6df7a788b\",\"Despite a recent increase in the greening of existing buildings, the literature continues to focus on investigating barriers to the greening of new buildings. The goal of this research was to develop a method using failure mode and effects analysis to investigate the barriers to the greening of existing buildings using the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design version 4 for Building Operations and Maintenance: Existing Buildings rating system. Its specific objectives included using this method to 1) investigate potential failure modes when certifying existing buildings using this rating system, as well as their causes and effects, 2) rank failure modes, effects and causes in order of priority and 3) identify opportunities and lessons learned from implementing this method. The research involved bringing together a focus group of five local experts who were familiar with the rating system for a one-day workshop. The experts, along with the research team, were tasked with identifying these potential failure modes along with their causes, effects and detection controls and with rating the probability of occurrence of the failure modes, the severity of the failure effects and the ease of detection of the failure controls. The analysis of the workshop data showed that over half of the identified failure causes were technical in nature, with financial causes and organizational causes representing 14% and 11% of all failure causes, respectively. The analysis also showed the intricate relationship between technical, financial, organizational, social and environmental factors; therefore, these different factors need to be integrated and interlinked, rather than compartmentalized and separated. This research provided a new comprehensive method based on the use of failure mode and effects analysis to evaluate the risks to the greening of existing buildings using the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating system. Workshop participants found failure mode and effects analysis to be an excellent method for identifying, evaluating and ranking green building certification risks because it helped to foster interdisciplinary collaboration between participants from various disciplines, as well as between researchers and industry stakeholders. Nevertheless, there is a need for future applications of the method to limit the scope of the analysis to specific categories or credits of the rating system. This narrow scope would facilitate the analysis of the workshop data and enable a more in-depth and comprehensive analysis of all risks and risk types, including ones that traditionally tend to be ignored, such as organizational and social risks. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 Elsevier Ltd\"\\n\"Brotman B.A.\",\"The feasibility of medical office building green upgrades from an owner/lessor perspective\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978140855&doi=10.1108%2fJPIF-03-2016-0017&partnerID=40&md5=54da1ea221c38e92a6ca90aae73f21c3\",\"Purpose \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The purpose of this paper is to exam the financial impact on the owner/lessor who is considering a partial energy upgrade to an existing medical office building. The owner who leases the building using a triple net lease does the upgrade prior to leasing the building, with the expectation of earning higher rents. How much should the owner who leases the property spend for a given rent per square foot increase? Design/methodology/approach \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The empirical study highlights the impact of key financial variables on the dependent variable medical office construction spending put in place in the USA. The independent variables prime interest rate, cost of natural gas per therm and electricity cost per KWH, resale building prices are significant variables when predicting medical office construction spending. A case study using a cost-benefit model is developed. It inputs corporate income tax rates, incorporates a debt service coverage ratio, prime interest rate, analyzes investment tax credit (ITC) and rebate scenarios and varies the level of rental income and energy savings. The case study results provide insight into which factors are enabling higher net construction spending when considering a green energy retrofit project. Both the regression model and the case study model focussed on the owner of a building who rents medical office space to tenants using a triple net lease. The owner/lessor paradigm analyzes revenue enhancements, the tax implications of having these savings and benefits associated with borrowing when financing the green retrofit. The availability of low cost borrowing, increases in the ITC percent and rebates and increases in rent per square foot have an impact on potential energy upgrade spending. Findings \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The empirical model finds the independent variables to be significant. Utility cost, resale value of office buildings, the prime interest rate, business bankruptcy court filings and unemployment rate fluctuations adequately explain movements in medical office building spending for the years 2000 through 2015 yielding a R2 of 73.8 percent. The feasibility case study indicates that the energy saving levels and ITCs not income tax rates are the primary drivers for a partial energy retrofit. Research limitations/implications \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Market incentives are a function of the cost of energy. If the cost of energy drops, then the profit incentive to conserve energy becomes less important. The role of tax credits, rebates, property tax reductions and government directives, then become primary incentives for installing energy upgrades. The owner of an empty building assumes all of the operating costs normally paid by a tenant under a triple net lease. This possibility was not included in the replacement cost-benefit model used in this paper. Practical implications \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The feasibility of doing an energy upgrade to an existing building requires that a cost-benefit analysis be undertaken. The independent variables that are significant when doing a regression model or proxies for these variables are incorporated into a present value model. The results in Table V can be used as an initial template for determining how much to spend per square foot when doing an energy upgrade. The square foot amounts can be applied to different size office buildings. The corporate income tax rate or a personal income tax rate has minimal impact on energy construction upgrade spending. Social implications \\xe2\\x80\\x93 More energy efficient office buildings reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. Energy efficient buildings also conserve on scarce fuel reserves. ITCs and rebates limit the role of government in directing decisions to do energy upgrades. The market mechanism to some degree can help encourage energy conservation through asset upgrades. Originality/value \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The paper incorporates an empirical model which is a form of technical analysis to examine independent variables that explain medical office building spending with a case study structured on expected revenues and costs which takes a fundamental approach to understanding the relationship between the dependent variable and its independent variables. The regression model combines factors that impact the demand for energy efficient medical buildings from an owner/lessor perspective which includes resale values of existing buildings, business bankruptcy filings and unemployment rates. Supply independent variables include the prime interest rate and electricity per KWH and natural gas per therm. The regression model found these variables to be significant. The case study uses the same independent variables or close proxy variables to determine the maximum financially feasible per square foot spending that can be invested in energy upgrades. \\xc2\\xa9 2016, \\xc2\\xa9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\"\\n\"Altun T., Bildik A., G\\xc3\\xb6k\\xc3\\xa7eoglu G.\",\"Bank credit applications and advancement recommendations in regards to sustainable buildings in Turkey\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014247920&doi=10.4018%2f978-1-5225-0440-5.ch0017&partnerID=40&md5=018caad5f6ad6fb329af87c4e4c27b1b\",\"There are a wide variety of buildings that have been distinguished from traditional buildings with respect to their design, construction and utilization processes.

WCU Facilities Management division has sought help in designing a project that will accomplish these goals. A 10 kW grid-tied PV system has been proposed that will be centrally located on campus. The system will serve as a living, learning laboratory for the campus community. The solar panels for the system will be mounted on three structures approximately 10 to 14 feet off the ground, which will also provide shade and shelter from the elements. Underneath the solar panels will be benches, tables, electrical outlets, and special hooks for students to hang hammocks. A small garden featuring native plant life will be planted around the solar panel structure. Small informational signage will be displayed throughout the garden informing visitors about the benefits of sustainable energy and how a PV system works. As part of this effort, an engineering capstone project team was responsible for researching, designing, and proposing a PV system for Western Carolina University. A shading analysis was first conducted in multiple locations on campus to determine where the most sunlight hours occurred. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory\\'s PVWatts1 Calculator was later utilized to estimate how much energy the system would generate per year and how much money the system would save the university. Greenhouse gas savings estimates were also calculated to determine the amount of reduction in CO2 emissions. Western Carolina University\\'s lead architect provided assistance with the structural design of the EGG and estimation of construction costs. Since the university is recommended to use a third party to install the PV system, a local installer was contacted to gather a professional opinion. The proposal was later submitted to the WCU Sustainable Energy Initiative (SEI) Committee, which allocates funds for sustainable energy projects on campus. After a formal presentation by the engineering capstone team, the WCU SEI Committee has decided to move forward with the project. The preliminary research involved gathering information on exactly how a PV system works. Further research revealed the necessity for Maximum Power Point Tracking in solar inverters. The engineering capstone team has investigated the benefits of oversizing a PV system with a 1.25 array-to-inverter ratio2. A vital part of this research involved emissions reduction calculations and payoff estimates. The emissions reduction calculations showed that the system would reduce CO2 emissions of the school by approximately five tons annually. Payoff of the system was calculated to be approximately 39.25 years. If the university were able to claim the 35 % North Carolina solar energy tax credits, the payoff would be reduced to approximately 12 years. Western Carolina University is situated in a fantastic location for solar energy to thrive, which makes the EGG a realistic and highly-desirable project. The research by the capstone team determined that the best option for WCU to raise awareness and educate students about renewable energy is to implement a flagship project that would serve to accomplish these goals. \\xc2\\xa9 American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.\"\\n\"Smith R.M., Bereitschaft B.\",\"Sustainable urban development?

The solvent is considered a greener chemical since it can be manufactured from renewable resources with a lower life cycle footprint. Analyses have been performed using different methods to show greenness in both its production and industrial use. This solvent can potentially be substituted for other ether and chlorinated solvents commonly used in organometallic and biphasic reactions steps in pharmaceutical and fine chemical syntheses. The 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran made from renewable agricultural by-products is marketed by Penn A Kem under the name ecoMeTHF\\xe2\\x84\\xa2. The starting material, 2-furfuraldehyde (furfural), is produced from corn cob waste by converting the available pentosans by acid hydrolysis. An evaluation of each step in the process was necessary to determine the overall life cycle and specific CO2 emissions for each raw material/intermediate produced. Allocation of credits for CO2 from the incineration of solvents made from renewable feedstocks significantly reduced the overall carbon footprint.

Due to its potential for cost reduction and energy saving, PLC is an attractive supplement to the Ethernet in next generation in-vehicle networks. This paper considers using HomePlug Green PHY (HomePlug GP) as an in-vehicle PLC network protocol due to its low cost, compact size, universal applicability, strong reliability and reduced overhead. To address the challenge of long latency in data transfer by HomePlug GP, we propose two queuing enhancements to improve the real-time performance of HomePlug GP. Specifically, we introduce the virtual collision mechanism to improve the fairness of queuing. We further apply the principle of credit-based shaping in IEEE 802.1 Audio Video Bridging over the HomePlug GP to meet the latency requirements of different network traffic.

A more reliable green points credit allocation for green building standards may be achieved using six different lifetime shearing layers: Site, Structure, Skin, Services, Space, and Stuff, each reflecting distinct environmental damages. This six shearing layer concept was applied to the Israeli Sustainable Standard (SI5281), BRE Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Green Star, and Sustainable Building Tool (SBTool) green rating systems. It was found that SI5281 focuses on the long lifetime expectancy building design, while BREEAM, LEED, and Green Star focus on the shorter lifetime expectancy system design.

The empirical study highlights the importance of utility cost, credit availability and producer price index for office construction on the amount of medical office building spending put in place. The independent variables prime interest rate, cost of natural gas per therm and electricity cost per KWH are significant variables. A cost-benefit model is developed that inputs several personal income tax rates, incorporates a debt-service coverage ratio, analyzes investment tax credit and rebate scenarios and varies the level of energy savings. The costbenefit case study results provide insight into which factors enable higher net construction spending when considering a green energy retrofit project. Both the regression model and the case study model focused on the tenant who rents medical office space using a triple net lease. The tenant paradigm limits the analysis to energy savings, the tax implications of having these savings and benefits associated with borrowing when financing the green retrofit.

Environmentally friendly buildings should also consider literally the impact that they have on birds, millions of them. A major factor in bird collisions with buildings is the choice of building materials. These choices are usually made by the architect who may not be aware of the issue or may be looking for guidance from certification programs such as LEED. As a proof of concept for an educational tool, we developed a software-assisted approach to characterize whether a proposed building design would earn a point for the LEED Pilot Credit 55: Avoiding Bird Collisions. Using the visual programming language Dynamo with the common building information modeling software Revit, we automated the assessment of designs.

LEED managers often attempt to achieve as many credits as possible with limited budgets and resources. However, referring to the credit requirements alone does not help evaluate the difficulty in achieving those credits. Data on how LEED credits were achieved in previous projects may offer some insights, yet no research has quantitatively analyzed the previous records. This study aims to analyze LEED credit achievements in previous projects using data driven techniques and provide LEED managers with a better understanding on the achievements of individual credits and related credits. 1000 projects certified by LEED-NC v3 were collected as the case base. A measurement called the percentage of average score (PAS) was proposed to analyze how individual credits were attained in the past. Credits like MRc6 and MRc3 were discovered to have stringent requirements and were rarely achieved. In addition, relationships among credits were analyzed using association rule mining. Thresholds for support and confidence were identified by implementing a classification algorithm namely CMAR. Among 224 pairs of related credits that are suggested by USGBC, 50 pairs were identified as strongly related. In addition, 13 new pairs of related credits that have not been suggested by USGBC were discovered. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.\"\\n\"Bozovic-Stamenovic R., Kishnani N., Tan B.K., Prasad D., Faizal F.\",\"Assessment of awareness of Green Mark (GM) rating tool by occupants of GM buildings and general public\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84921328373&doi=10.1016%2fj.enbuild.2015.01.003&partnerID=40&md5=b02448d25e678a3b87b524bac2594160\",\"This paper addresses the issue of awareness of Green buildings, Green lifestyle and environmental matters with the aim to depict if GM (Green Mark) rating tool operates in a consumer climate that is knowledgeable. The post-occupancy evaluation of 11 office buildings in Singapore documented a range of performance indicators but also included questions concerning well-being, occupants\\' expectations, awareness of GM and public expectations. This is augmented with a public survey that asked how GM and Green living are perceived. Over 2200 building occupants are surveyed in the 11 case studies, plus another 315 members of public at various locations across Singapore. Results suggest that although the awareness of Green Mark rating tool was not established well the awareness of Green lifestyle is closely connected to self-reported wellness. The implications and possible effects of raising the awareness of GM on strengthening the GM tool are discussed. Since GM buildings should visibly reflect public expectations, a revision of what GM rewards through its credit structure might be required in the future. In conclusion, the awareness of Green lifestyle is connected to positive mood regarding GM rated buildings and therefore essential for further development and fine-tuning of the GM rating tool. \\xc2\\xa9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However conditions have changed since the well-documented successes of the 1960s and 1970s benefitted smallholders in southern Asia and beyond. We argue that under contemporary constraints the mechanisms for achieving improvements in the lives of smallholder farmers through such policies are unclear and that both policy rationale and means of governing agricultural innovation are crucial for pro-poor impacts. To critically analyze Rwanda\\'s Green Revolution policies and impacts from a local perspective, a mixed methods, multidimensional wellbeing approach is applied in rural areas in mountainous western Rwanda. Here Malthusian policy framing has been used to justify imposed rather than \"\"induced innovation\"\". The policies involve a substantial transformation for rural farmers from a traditional polyculture system supporting subsistence and local trade to the adoption of modern seed varieties, inputs, and credit in order to specialize in marketable crops and achieve increased production and income. Although policies have been deemed successful in raising yields and conventionally measured poverty rates have fallen over the same period, such trends were found to be quite incongruous with local experiences. Disaggregated results reveal that only a relatively wealthy minority were able to adhere to the enforced modernization and policies appear to be exacerbating landlessness and inequality for poorer rural inhabitants. Negative impacts were evident for the majority of households as subsistence practices were disrupted, poverty exacerbated, local systems of knowledge, trade, and labor were impaired, and land tenure security and autonomy were curtailed. In order to mitigate the effects we recommend that inventive pro-poor forms of tenure and cooperation (none of which preclude improvements to input availability, market linkages, and infrastructure) may provide positive outcomes for rural people, and importantly in Rwanda, for those who have become landless in recent years. We conclude that policies promoting a Green Revolution in Sub-Saharan Africa should not all be considered to be pro-poor or even to be of a similar type, but rather should be the subject of rigorous impact assessment. Such assessment should be based not only on consistent, objective indicators but pay attention to localized impacts on land tenure, agricultural practices, and the wellbeing of socially differentiated people. \\xc2\\xa9 2015 The Authors.\"\\n\"Bayhan H.G., Gurgun A.P.\",\"Evaluation of leed certified green buildings\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116530690&doi=10.14455%2fISEC.res.2016.100&partnerID=40&md5=79c6a6ef3b65e3471378ce8f40826bee\",\"Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design, LEED, is one of the most recognized green building certification systems in the world. Turkey is also one of the countries, where it is widely used. It offers different rating groups to address varying requirements of building and project types. LEED-v3 NC, the rating group for new construction, includes seven categories of credits: sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor air quality, innovation, and regional priority. The maximum achievable point is 110. Local conditions significantly affect the achievement of some of the credits, as LEED is originated in the USA. This study focuses on the assessment of 122 LEED-v3 NC certified buildings in Turkey, considering the points achieved in each category. The aim is to understand which categories are successfully fulfilled and more challenging for implementation. Analysis results show that buildings receive higher points from water efficiency, sustainable sites, innovation and regional priorities, when compared to indoor environmental quality, energy and atmosphere and material and resources categories in Turkey. The lowest category is identified as material and resources. This situation should lead the new projects taking precautions to this individual area especially at the beginning of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplanning step\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in construction process. Recognizing the successful implementations for earning points and the challenging issues in Turkish construction industry regarding green buildings can be of benefit for professionals in this area. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 ISEC Press.\"\\n\"Potter G.\",\"The criminogenic effects of environmental harm: Bringing a \\xe2\\x80\\x98green\\xe2\\x80\\x99 perspective to mainstream criminology\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106499945&doi=10.4324%2f9781315580005-8&partnerID=40&md5=d484f53f118bc4adc024cdd8b8e0e170\",\"This chapter explores the political economy of carbon and the ways in which trading schemes have provided new opportunities for fraud and tax evasion.

Initially, planning for rapid development focused mainly on technical, economic and financial aspects, with social and environmental aspects remaining into the background. Gradually, things began to change. In 1989, environment emerged as an additional input into the process of development planning. While formal SIA does not exist in China as yet, key development agencies have begun moving in this direction. And for certain kinds of projects SIA has now become a formal requirement. In addition to focusing on SIA experience in China, this overview also looks at the impacts of it growing investment projects in Africa and other countries in Asia and Latin America.

The tool provides up to 3 points for acoustics, one of which is for Acoustic Separation. The point is achieved under 10.3A when Rw45 walls are specified for \\'enclosed spaces\\'. The AAAC Guideline for Commercial Building Acoustics rates Rw45 as a \\'good\\' level of sound reduction and Rw50 as \\'very good\\'. Alternatively, the credit is achieved under 10.3B using the measured Dw and LAeq to estimate speech privacy. This is based on a method from British Standard BS8233:1999. The approaches in 10.3A and 10.3B use different descriptors to evaluate acoustical separation performance. Application of 10.3A or 10.3B may not necessarily result in equivalent outcomes for acoustical speech privacy. In this paper, the comparative acoustical speech privacy outcomes from typical wall constructions are compared using the analysis method provided in Australian Standard AS2822 Acoustics - methods of assessing and predicting speech privacy and speech intelligibility. The analysis has indicated that while the Rw descriptor is a generally good comparison for plasterboard-based wall constructions, evaluating masonry wall constructions using this method may not result in commensurate speech privacy outcomes. Furthermore, the low frequency performance of certain wall constructions may have a tendency to affect the Rw rating by allowing a reduced performance at speech frequencies whilst maintaining the overall performance and thus over-estimate the speech privacy outcomes of the wall.\"\\n\"Bellwood-Howard I., Al-Hassan S.\",\"Fertiliser credit and agroecological use of organic soil amendments in Northern Ghana\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019925638&doi=10.18697%2fajfand.74.15770&partnerID=40&md5=5c1d87a8e62d238461eeb2bf7879c266\",\"Contemporary African agricultural policy embodies the African Green Revolution\\'s drive towards modernisation and commercialisation. Agroecologists have criticised this movement on ecological, social and political grounds. Northern Ghanaian fertiliser credit schemes provide a good example through which these critiques can be examined in a context where agricultural policy reflects the African Green Revolution\\'s ideals. This study aimed to determine the relationship of such credit schemes to farmers\\' use of organic amendments, elucidate other factors related to organic amendment use, and comment on the relevance of this modernisation policy and its relationship to agroecology. A first research phase employed semi-structured key informant interviews. Qualitative data from these informed construction of a semi-structured questionnaire that was used in a survey of 205 farmers. Multistage sampling purposively identified five villages and selected farmers within who had joined government and donor-funded fertiliser credit schemes. The use of organic and inorganic amendments was compared to that of peers who had not taken part in such schemes. Quantitative data were used in binomial logistic regression, inferential and descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were content analysed. Credit group membership was associated with higher fertiliser application and yield, but had little influence on the extent of commercialisation. Farmers who applied organic amendments were 40% less likely to belong to a fertiliser credit scheme than not, indicating substitution between organic and inorganic fertilisers. Organic amendments were 40% more likely to be applied to compound farms than outfields and six times more likely to be applied by household heads than other household members. However, household heads also preferentially joined credit groups. This was part of an agroecological soil fertility management strategy. Household heads appreciated the soil moisture retention properties of organic amendments, and applied them to compound farms to reduce risk to their household food supply in a semi-arid environment. They simultaneously accessed fertiliser to enhance this household provisioning strategy. They appreciated the increased yields this achieved, yet complained that the repayment terms of credit schemes were unfair, fertiliser did not enhance yields in dry conditions and fertilisers were supplied late. Farmers\\' use of credited fertiliser alongside their existing agroecological strategy is helpful to the extent that it raises yields, yet is problematic in that it conflicts with risk-reduction strategies based on organics. There is some potential for modernised and agroecological management paradigms to coexist. For fertiliser credit to play a role in this, schemes must use fairer repayment terms and involve a focus on simultaneous use of organic amendments.\"\\n\"Venkatesan M., Ramachandran K., Barathkumar T.R., Lekshmisree S.L., Pugalzhenthi R., Jayachandran S., Ramachandran S.\",\"Ameliorative role of marine seaweed bioactives against Parkinson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disease\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019889993&partnerID=40&md5=87ecb2ae8a05c42378e3d268ee1ff437\",\"Parkinson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent multi-factorial neurological disorder affecting elderly population next to Alzheimer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disease.

Under CDM, developing countries can invest in carbon emissionreduction technologies and earn certified emission reduction credits which can be then traded in the carbon market. In India, most of the carbon projects are implemented in the energy sector. Very few projects are concerned with rural development. Also, carbon projects in India are not compliant with the policy of IPCC 2007 which says that sustainable development must have environmental, economic and social dimensions.

In terms of improving or enhancing occupant well-being, a unique case emerges for healthcare facilities, whose main existence is based on the principles of improving the health of their patients. In the U.S., the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system has become the most widely recognized and used certification system for green buildings, including green hospital buildings. However, hospitals with high total scores may be green buildings but not necessarily the optimal green healthcare environment from a patient\\'s wellbeing perspective. The goal of the study was to identify whether hospitals and healthcare facilities actually value the specific criteria that influence the health of patients and their recovery period. In-depth analysis of LEED healthcare specific credits revealed general tendencies and practices for green healthcare buildings. Based on a statistical analysis, the mean of percent healthcare specific scores were calculated as 48% for those certified under LEED Healthcare, 62% for hospitals certified under LEED New Construction v3, and 52% for hospitals certified under LEED New Construction v2 rating systems. While hospitals included in the Healthcare category were initially expected to be the most successful ones in terms of achieving patient recovery and wellbeing related credits, they proved to earn the lowest percent of relevant points in this analysis. The result may be attributed to heightened restrictions and requirements of credits in the Healthcare scorecard, or hospitals may be valuing the level of certification more than those credits that were deemed relevant for patient wellbeing and rate of recovery, either due to lack of information or due to economic constraints. A high correlation coefficient was calculated among total scores and healthcare specific scores for the Healthcare dataset. On the other hand, correlation coefficients calculated for the other two datasets indicate a more random pattern among the two variables. For hospitals certified under the New Construction rating system, there seem to be weak support to claim that hospitals that receive high total scores and thus certification levels have high healthcare specific points as well. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 The Authors.\"\\n\"Sadatsafavi H., Shepley M.M.\",\"Performance Evaluation of 32 LEED Hospitals on Operation Costs\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84999636147&doi=10.1016%2fj.proeng.2016.04.159&partnerID=40&md5=1dece53544bd4effd8785243117cc7eb\",\"Growth in healthcare needs challenges providers to reduce operational costs and is expected to increase construction and renovation of healthcare facilities.

The study aims to highlight how the materials characteristics can affect building energy and environmental performance and to point out the different approaches of the analyzed protocols. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 by the authors.\"\\n\"Gou Z.\",\"Green building for office interiors: challenges and opportunities\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986192030&doi=10.1108%2fF-04-2015-0022&partnerID=40&md5=a294ca94e30ca50dc0dac0917aaf26e1\",\"Purpose: This paper aims to examine the concept and practice of green building for office interiors: whether the green intent can be effectively implemented in an interior retrofitting project. Design/methodology/approach: Reviewing green building rating systems for interiors, examining certified interior projects and interviewing occupants working in certified green offices. Findings: The green building credits for interiors fall into three relational layers: the urban context, the host building and interior fit-outs. Most projects under study performed well on credits for interior fit-outs (e.g. low emitting materials, energy efficient equipment and appliances, etc.), while underperformed on credits for its host building (e.g. air-conditioning systems, ventilation, etc.). The latter might more significantly affect working experience. The other important green aspects, such as daylight availability, facilities accessibility, might be subject to its location and urban context. Research limitations/implications: This article presents a multi-examination of green interiors. The data came from second-hand Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design scorecards and qualitative interviews. More quantitative surveys are expected to be conducted. Practical implications: Green interior retrofitting should go beyond selecting environmental-friendly finishes and furniture or resource-efficient fixtures and appliances. It should proactively start from assessing the environmental performance of the host building and its urban context. Originality/value: Most research looked at green building as a whole. Green interiors are actually more practical for tenants who intend to reduce their corporate environmental impacts, whereas they do not have control over whole building design and operations. This article highlights the importance of green interior retrofitting and provides guidance. \\xc2\\xa9 2016, \\xc2\\xa9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\"\\n\"Woods C.\",\"How Ground Improvement Contributes to the Green Building Movement\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84985038514&doi=10.1061%2f9780784480120.071&partnerID=40&md5=d82618df45a09df9e8073ea3bcaa076a\",\"Owing to the tremendous efforts of the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) and the development of the LEED rating system, a mechanism has been created to evaluate construction projects from a \"\"green building\"\" standpoint. Using a free, foundation industry-specific carbon calculator tool for this study, the carbon footprint of a theoretical project was evaluated for four separate foundation options on the given site, using consumption data from real projects. Two methods of ground improvement, dynamic compaction and aggregate piers were the first two options considered, the third option was driven pile foundations, and the final option was a full removal of the unsuitable fill material and replacement with imported structural fill. Results of the study indicated that under the assumed conditions, ground improvement programs can have a carbon footprint on the order of 2 to 6% of the footprint associated with full removal of the fill material to send to a landfill. As such, this paper recommends that further evaluation be given towards establishing a new LEED credit related to geotechnical construction issues, or at minimum, establishing a carbon footprint reduction scorecard that could be incorporated into the existing LEED infrastructure.\"\\n\"Xiao P., Liu D.-B.\",\"Improving accuracy of virtual machine power model by relative-pmc based heuristic scheduling\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84981216505&partnerID=40&md5=090e0b7f448807cef76f2c6bbe49bb13\",\"Conventional utilization-based power model is effective for measuring the power consumption of physical machines. However, in virtualized environments its accuracy cannot be guaranteed because of the recursive resource accessing among multiple virtual machines. In this paper, we present a novel virtual machine scheduling algorithm, which uses Performance-Monitor-Counter as heuristic information to compensate the recursive power consumption. Theoretical analysis indicates that the error of virtual machine power model can be quantitative bounded when using the proposed scheduling algorithm. Extensive experiments based on standard benchmarks show that the error of virtual machine power measurements can be significantly reduced comparing with the classic credit-based scheduling algorithm.\"\\n\"Ryu H.-S., Park K.-S.\",\"A study on the LEED energy simulation process using BIM\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84960403896&doi=10.3390%2fsu8020138&partnerID=40&md5=0380afe66af9414bab0b026fd8eb494b\",\"In the domestic and international environmentally friendly certification system, energy-related credit occupies a high ratio in the total distribution of certification score Leadership in the Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) system is a certification system developed by the US Green Building Council (USGBC) in order to assess the environmental friendliness of buildings.

Which factors determine small-scale plant species richness of small linear grassland elements in a Japanese agricultural landscape? Location: Shiga Prefecture, Japan. Methods: Aerial photos from 1963, 1985, 1995 and 2008 were used to investigate landscape changes and to measure landscape structures within a typical agricultural landscape (~25 km2). Plant diversity was investigated in ten paddy levees and ten road verges in each of four traditional (barely any land cover alterations after 1963) and five modern (almost completely changed after 1985) sites. \\xce\\xb1-diversity (mean number of species per plot) and \\xce\\xb3-diversity (total number of species) for all species, specialist and invasive species, respectively, were analysed in relation to site history types and landscape structures. Plot species richness was analysed in relation to site history type, patch age and width, proximity to forest and litter removal. Results: In total, 204 plant species were found, 55 species unique to traditional sites and 13 unique to modern sites. \\xce\\xb1- and \\xce\\xb3-diversity of paddy levees and road verges was significantly higher in traditional sites. Number of specialist species on paddy levees and number of invasive species in road verges was also higher in traditional sites. Age was the strongest predictor of plot species richness on levees; older levees supported higher species richness than younger ones. Litter removal was the strongest predictor (positive effect) of plot species richness in road verges. Conclusions: These results suggest that the colonization credit of new levees in modern sites is decreasing quite rapidly as species quickly establish, approaching almost the same richness values as in traditional sites. However, long continuity of traditional management is still one of the most important contributors to plant diversity and crucial for many species. But small grassland elements can still be of great significance for preserving and enhancing plant diversity in otherwise depleted landscapes, as long as they are managed and connected throughout the landscape. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 International Association for Vegetation Science.\"\\n\"Campiglio E.\",\"Beyond carbon pricing: The role of banking and monetary policy in financing the transition to a low-carbon economy\",2016,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84952864525&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolecon.2015.03.020&partnerID=40&md5=75927442eb37e662d0d954fee67a5c35\",\"It is widely acknowledged that introducing a price on carbon represents a crucial precondition for filling the current gap in low-carbon investment. However, as this paper argues, carbon pricing in itself may not be sufficient. This is due to the existence of market failures in the process of creation and allocation of credit that may lead commercial banks - the most important source of external finance for firms - not to respond as expected to price signals. Under certain economic conditions, banks would shy away from lending to low-carbon activities even in the presence of a carbon price. This possibility calls for the implementation of additional policies not based on prices. In particular, the paper discusses the potential role of monetary policies and macroprudential financial regulation: modifying the incentives and constraints that banks face when deciding their lending strategy - through, for instance, a differentiation of reserve requirements according to the destination of lending - may fruitfully expand credit creation directed towards low-carbon sectors. This seems to be especially feasible in emerging economies, where the central banking framework usually allows for a stronger public control on credit allocation and a wider range of monetary policy instruments than the sole interest rate. \\xc2\\xa9 2015 Elsevier B.V.\"\\n\"Thakur J., Chakraborty B.\",\"A study of feasible smart tariff alternatives for smart grid integrated solar panels in India\",2015,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84949639260&doi=10.1016%2fj.energy.2015.09.100&partnerID=40&md5=864e66ea162a69e2a443755f008ca725\",\"With the advent of grid connected solar panels in India, the requirement of a separate mechanism for metering and billing is foreseen. The policy framework for addressing this need is under process in various states of India. In the smart grid pilot project at Puducherry, India, a simple net metering mechanism has been incorporated to evaluate and understand the performance of green energy generation through solar panels. The present paper draws a comparison between net metering and gross metering mechanisms, through the analysis of net meter data collected for three different types of consumers from the pilot project at Puducherry. Different scenarios have been evaluated to infer the impacts of specialized billing mechanisms as well as the payback periods on investment made for solar energy systems and the savings that is reflected in the monthly bills. Feed in tariff renders full credit to the renewable energy customers on their electricity bills for the amount of green power, which is sent back to the main grid. This simple mechanism of a credit system would prove to be the most important energy policy for a nation to encourage sustainable energy generation. Due to wide variations in tariffs, requirements and efficiency of utilities across the different states in India, a policy which can accommodate mechanisms of community net metering and aggregate net metering had become a necessity. The paper signifies the crucial and immediate necessity for a feasible and acceptable energy policy so as to realize the benefits of power from the sun. \\xc2\\xa9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.\"\\n\"Cracknell T.M., Abu-Hijleh B.\",\"Measuring LEED-NC applicability in design for hospitality\",2015,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006220509&doi=10.1016%2fj.foar.2015.09.002&partnerID=40&md5=84a2f7a544ab795ec7e27887fa667258\",\"Mounting awareness of climate change in recent years has led the construction industry to initiate new approaches toward sustainable building design, yet stakeholders in hospitality development still hesitate to build green. This reluctance is due to perceived high guest expectations of comfort levels and amenity access among these properties.

Average LEED credit implementation rates among 28 existing LEED hotel projects were calculated and compared with average credits employed among common commercial building projects. 15 of those projects\\' designers also offered survey opinions on which sustainable innovations were most commonly avoided in their approaches for hospitality. The results indicate that certain credits do experience decreased popularity among hospitality projects, yet guest comfort was not the only barrier identified.

Although the need for LEED certification has grown significantly, LEED managers still face challenges in target credit selection and green building technology design. They frequently meet new types of projects with different project characteristics and requirements. Therefore, it would be helpful if LEED managers could refer to other similar certified green building cases when planning and designing LEED projects. However, this is not supported in current studies and research. This paper proposes a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach to provide case studies of similar certified green building projects and suggestions on target LEED credits. Currently, linear formation of Local-Global method is commonly used in the retrieval step of CBR. This paper presents a non-linear formation of Local-Global retrieval based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which can provide a higher accuracy.

Pairwise comparison was conducted to generate the local distance (attribute similarity) and the target for training the ANN model. The proposed non-linear CBR approach was tested and evaluated using 20 recently certified projects, and the results showed a prediction accuracy of 80.75% on the LEED credit selection. The results were also compared with those calculated by commonly used linear CBR approaches: Multiple Regression Analysis, Correlation Analysis, and the k-NN approach. The accuracy achieved by these methods was between 71.23% and 77.54%, which was lower than the proposed approach. \\xc2\\xa9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.\"\\n\"Sharma C., Jain A.\",\"PV Based Green Computing System for ICT Sustainable Development\",2015,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959058145&doi=10.1109%2fICACCE.2015.40&partnerID=40&md5=ec37ad3412e5db9bc249737c30a3868f\",\"Photovoltaics (PV) appear to be upcoming solution for triple crunch i.e. Credit, climate and energy crisis.

Design The study was quasi-experimental and integrated into courses for credit/extra credit. Courses were randomly stratified into experimental or non-treatment control. The 5-week intervention consisted of four modules based on different GE topics. Participants completed the GE survey at baseline (experimental, n 241; control, n 367) and post (experimental, n 187; control, n 304). The GE survey has been previously validated and consists of Transtheoretical Model constructs including stage of change (SOC), decisional balance (DB: Pros and Cons) and self-efficacy (SE: School and Home) as well as behaviours for GE. Modules contained basic information regarding each topic and knowledge items to assess content learning. Setting The GE Project took place at a public university in the north-eastern USA. Subjects Participants were full-time students between the ages of 18 and 24 years. Results The GE Project was effective in significantly increasing GE behaviours, DB Pros, SE School and knowledge in experimental compared with control, but did not reduce DB Cons or increase SE Home. Experimental participants were also more likely to be in later SOC for GE at post testing. Conclusions The GE Project was effective in increasing GE behaviours in university students. Motivating consumers towards adopting GE could assist in potentially mitigating negative consequences of the food system on the environment.

To achieve these ends, sustainable road rating systems have been developed in a number of countries that integrate sustainable practices into their specific local context. The objective of this research was thus to develop a green road rating system for South Korea. A green road rating system framework was developed based on existing green road rating systems that includes suitable categories, indicators, and credits, and applies appropriate weightings to each. A green road rating system manual was created to provide a comprehensive guide for the design and construction of green roads that can also be used as an education manual for construction professionals and students; the associated web-based certification and registration system will support and facilitate a viable green road construction certification system for South Korea. The authors present a number of recommendations related to the development of a green road rating system tool, including a detailed process for creating an assessment framework, identifying categories, indicators, and credits, and assigning weightings. The green rating system proposed here will not only help achieve the goals of sustainability but will also change the paradigm of road construction and construction education in South Korea. \\xc2\\xa9 2016 Taylor & Francis.\"\\n\"Bastiaensen J., Huybrechs F., Forcella D., Van Hecken G.\",\"Microfinance plus for ecosystem services: A territorial perspective on Proyecto CAMBio in Nicaragua\",2015,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020912263&doi=10.3362%2f1755-1986.2015.025&partnerID=40&md5=304cbf69f796ed205ed1dcec60b815ca\",\"Drawing from discussions on the panacea problem in microfinance and natural resource management, we scrutinize a \\'green microfinance plus\\' programme - Proyecto CAMBio - in a specific setting in Nicaragua, focusing in particular on its interaction with local development pathways.

In our case study, we highlight the focus on individual producers, the implicit targeting of more established medium-sized producers, and the uncritical promotion of a particular technical model of production. The project might thereby have failed to identify and revert some negative processes of environmental degradation and did not consciously engage with the dynamics and political arenas of sustainable development. We call for a more holistic territorial perspective that is conducive to more strategic thinking about the interactive socio-technical dynamics and ensuing opportunities and constraints for different producer types and technical-commercial models.

Buildings can be graded as Platinum, Gold, Silver, or Certified depending on the number of LEED credit points achieved. Selection of LEED credits is an important step in LEED certification planning and application. The relationships between LEED credit achievement and project factors like budget and schedule have already been studied. Apart from these, climate factors such as temperature and precipitation can also affect the selection of green building technologies and therefore the LEED credits achieved. However, study on the relationships between LEED credit achievement and the climate of the building location is lacking. This paper investigates the relationship between climate factors and LEED credits using data mining techniques. The LEED credits achieved and the local climate conditions of 912 LEED certified existing building projects were collected and analyzed. By setting the climate factors as variables and the credit achievements as the targets, 26 classification models were built using the Random Forests classification algorithm. The variable importance for each credit was then calculated based on the contribution to the classification performance. For the models with high AUC performance, high importance climate factors were identified and discussed. The results show that some climate factors, such as diurnal temperature range, have a notable correlation with the achievement of certain LEED credits. Implications and contributions of the results are also discussed. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.\"\\n\"Zhou Y.-S., Liu Q.-R., Li J., Zhao Y.-X.\",\"Game model for governments to promote banks as the agency to supervise the implementation of green supply chain based on green credit\",2015,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84940979185&partnerID=40&md5=62448b9ff865f1441c56eec3f22ac192\",\"This paper introduces the green credit to promote the development of green supply chain.

Lifecycle cost reduction is a major driver for designing green buildings. LEED rating system has been well recognised and widely used in the green building industry. However, certification cost incurred in time and money is often a deterrent for some projects. Design/methodology/approach: LEPOST automatically maps EnergyPlus and eQUEST energy simulation results to the LEED energy performance requirement submission templates using an extensible markup language (XML) data structure. It incorporates the Energy Star Target Finder online engine and current utility data to calculate points required to assess LEED Energy and Atmosphere Prerequisite 2 and Credit 1 automatically. Findings: A comparative case study is conducted using an office building project. The study results show that the tool can reduce the amount of time for the LEED energy performance evaluation and submission process from more than 6 hours to 2 minutes. The total number of manual data entries is reduced from 442 to 20. Research limitations/implications: Future work includes the update to support LEED V4, the development of a parametric design function that can help design teams perform design alternatives to evaluate energy performance with minimum effort, and the integration with the LEED Online system. Practical implications: The use of the tool by the building industry may decrease the cost of LEED certification for building owners, developers and design teams by simplifying the submission process. Originality/value: The overall development framework of LEPOST contributes to the knowledge of the data interoperability in the building sector by demonstrating a viable solution to extract and map digital model information for achieving code and standard compliance purposes. \\xc2\\xa9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\"\\n\"Petratos P., Damaskou E.\",\"Management strategies for sustainability education, planning, design, energy conservation in California higher education\",2015,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84930721015&doi=10.1108%2fIJSHE-03-2014-0038&partnerID=40&md5=7f4e7788886d50b04c04f2044ee2537a\",\"Purpose \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The purpose of this paper is to describe and analyze the effects of campus sustainability planning to annual campus energy inflows and outflows in California higher education.

Building environmental assessment schemes, and green building rating tools (GBRTs) have been adopted by architects, engineers and researchers for more than 20 years to help promote more sustainable construction activities. Each rating tool highlights energy use as a significant portion of the assessment and provides guidance on more energy efficient strategies. Building energy efficiency can usually be improved by both passive and active technologies. Active design involves making more energy efficient heating, ventilation, air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, hot water production, lighting and any other building services application, whereas passive design focuses more on building envelope related aspects determined by the architectural design so as to reduce the demand of the building for energy. Recently, there has been renewed interest in passive strategies because of the low extra investment and the potential benefits in energy saving. The passive design approach has also been recognized in the latest versions of green building rating tools. Five representative rating systems, which all developed their own passive design criteria leading to the award of credits, are subject to comparative examinations in respect of the comprehensiveness, effectiveness and accuracy of each criterion in this paper. Passive design criteria including the building layout, envelope thermophysics, building geometry, air-tightness and infiltration performance and their effects on building energy consumption are also comprehensively reviewed. The results show that a holistic design approach based on passive energy saving strategies proves to be an effective way to reduce building energy budgets. However, more consolidated weighting systems to enable comparison of different passive strategies should be incorporated in green building rating tools based on further sensitivity and parametric studies. \\xc2\\xa9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, at petroleum spill sites, these emissions can be significant, and some remedial actions can decrease this additional component of the environmental footprint. This article demonstrates an emissions assessment for a hypothetical site, using the following technologies as examples: excavation with disposal to a landfill, light nonaqueous-phase liquid (LNAPL) recovery with and without recovered product recycling, passive bioventing, and monitored natural attenuation (MNA). While the emissions associated with remediation for LNAPL recovery are greater than the other considered alternatives, this technology is comparable to excavation when a credit associated with product recycling is counted. Passive bioventing, a green remedial alternative, has greater remedial emissions than MNA, but unlike MNA can decrease contaminant-related emissions by converting subsurface methane to carbon dioxide. For the presented example, passive bioventing has the lowest total emissions of all technologies considered. This illustrates the value in estimating both remediation and contaminant respiration emissions for petroleum spill sites, so that the benefit of green remedial approaches can be quantified at the remedial alternatives selection stage rather than simply as best management practices. \\xc2\\xa9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\"\\n\"Varrette S., Plugaru V., Guzek M., Besseron X., Bouvry P.\",\"HPC Performance and Energy-Efficiency of the OpenStack Cloud Middleware\",2015,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84946574186&doi=10.1109%2fICPPW.2014.62&partnerID=40&md5=766395b30bc6e7aaea5cf241a55cb556\",\"Since its advent in the middle of the 2000\\'s, the Cloud Computing (CC) paradigm is increasingly advertised as THE solution to most IT problems. While High Performance Computing (HPC) centers continuously evolve to provide more computing power to their users, several voices (most probably commercial ones) emit the wish that CC platforms could also serve HPC needs and eventually replace in-house HPC platforms. However, it is still unclear whether the overhead induced by the virtualization layer at the heart of every Cloud middleware suits an environment as high-demanding as an HPC platform. In parallel, with a growing concern for the considerable energy consumed by HPC platforms and data centers, research efforts are targeting green approaches with higher energy efficiency. At this level, virtualization is also emerging as the prominent approach to reduce the energy consumed by consolidating multiple running VM instances on a single server, thus giving credit towards a Cloud-based approach. In this paper, we analyze from an HPC perspective the performance and the energy efficiency of the leading open source Cloud middleware, OpenStack, when compared to a bare-metal (i.e. native) configuration.

In order to abstract from the specifics of a single architecture, the benchmarks were run using two different hardware configurations, based on Intel and AMD processors. This work extends previous studies dedicated to the evaluation of hypervisors against HPC workloads. The results of this study pleads for in-house HPC platforms running without any virtualized frameworks, assessing that the current implementation of Cloud middleware is not well adapted to the execution of HPC applications. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 IEEE.\"\\n\"Suzer O.\",\"A comparative review of environmental concern prioritization: LEED vs other major certification systems\",2015,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84924028443&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2015.02.029&partnerID=40&md5=0e5fe32cc5dbe96bc1c80b4b4c41fc86\",\"The matter of environmental concern prioritization integrated into globally used green building rating systems is a fundamental issue since it determines how the performance of a structure or development is reflected. Certain nationally-developed certification systems are used globally without being subjected to adjustments with respect to local geographical, cultural, economic and social parameters.

In the agri-food sector, companies which achieve climate neutral agri-food products are distinguished by climate-neutral labels, in recognition of their social responsibility and contribution to environment protection. Valid CO2 certificates which minimize climate-impacting emissions include the right to achieve net zero carbon emissions by offsetting or buying enough carbon credits to achieve carbon neutral, or having a net zero carbon footprint. Furthermore, value adding can be achieved in the customer-driven value creation chains, as more and more consumers are becoming aware of the company\\'s contribution in environmental protection. In this respect, the aim of this study is to shed light in the specific attributes and perspectives of such practices and to explore how they can transform the challenge of climate change to opportunity for environment protection and sustainability. The paper highlights the need for successfully implemented climate neutral products and services, involving collaborative innovations which may also result in total cost reduction and product quality upgrading, particularly if incorporated in Sustainable or Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM). Moreover, social and company benefits can accrue especially for agri-food products which have already labels like protected designation of origin (PDO), protected geographical indication (PGI) and traditional specialty guaranteed (TSG). This paper also includes a survey conducted with consumers for assessing their behavioral patterns with regard to such issues. Finally, the major contribution of this study is the development of a conceptual model that presents the necessary managerial steps towards the production of green and climate neutral products.\"\\n\"Kloepper K.D.\",\"Stoplight quizzes: A multilevel assessment strategy for lecture and laboratory courses\",2015,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84924352070&doi=10.1021%2fed500512u&partnerID=40&md5=975c232c13084c0f1ff5b59112f8e810\",\"A multilevel assessment strategy, called the stoplight quiz, has been developed and implemented in analytical chemistry courses.

In the individual phase, students record answers in green ink. This is followed by group work during which students can modify their answers with orange ink. The instructor later marks the work in red ink. Correct work in green receives full credit, correct work in orange earns half credit, and red marks receive no credit. This assessment technique has many positive outcomes including increasing student motivation and student understanding of material.

The investigated green concrete mixes were prepared from three different types of industrial by-products, i.e. (1) foundry sand, and (2) steel slag, both of which were used as manufactured aggregates, and (3) fly ash, which was used as a mineral admixture. Some green concrete mixes were also prepared from a recycled aggregate, which was obtained from reinforced concrete waste. In some of the green concrete mixes the recycled aggregate was used in combination with the above-mentioned types of manufactured aggregate and fly ash. All of these materials are able, to some extent, to replace natural aggregate or Portland cement in concrete mixes, thus providing an environmental benefit from the point of view of the saving of natural resources. Taking into account consequential modelling, the credit related to the avoidance of the need to dispose of the waste materials is considered as a benefit. In case of the recycling of waste concrete into aggregate, credit is attributed to the recovery of scrap iron from the steel reinforcement. In the case of the use of steel slag, credit is attributed to the recovery of metals, which are extracted from the slag before being used as an alternative material. The disadvantage of using alternative materials and recycled aggregates can sometimes be their relatively long delivery distance. For this reason, a transport sensitivity analysis was carried out. The results indicate that the use of the discussed alternative and recycled materials is beneficial in the concrete production industry. Preference is given to the fly ash and foundry sand scenarios, and especially to those scenarios which are based on the combined use of recycled aggregate with these two alternative materials. It was found that longer delivery distances of the alternative materials do not necessarily affect the results significantly. However, variable delivery distances may have a greater effect when choosing between different alternative scenarios. \\xc2\\xa9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.\"\\n\"Xiong Y., Krogmann U., Mainelis G., Rodenburg L.A., Andrews C.J.\",\"Indoor air quality in green buildings: A case-study in a residential high-rise building in the northeastern United States\",2015,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84921346013&doi=10.1080%2f10934529.2015.981101&partnerID=40&md5=f31299081874eb699095c358558dd459\",\"Improved indoor air quality (IAQ) is one of the critical components of green building design. Green building tax credit (e.g., New York State Green Building Tax Credit (GBTC)) and certifi cation programs (e.g., Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED)) require indoor air quality measures and compliance with allowable maximum concentrations of common indoor air pollutants. It is not yet entirely clear whether compliance with these programs results in improved IAQ and ultimately human health. As a case in point, annual indoor air quality measurements were conducted in a residential green high-rise building for five consecutive years by an industrial hygiene contractor to comply with the building\\'s GBTC requirements. The implementation of green design measures resulted in better IAQ compared to data in references of conventional homes for some parameters, but could not be confirmed for others. Relative humidity and carbon dioxide were satisfactory according to existing standards. Formaldehyde levels during four out of five years were below the most recent proposed exposure limits found in the literature. To some degree, particulate matter (PM) levels were lower than that in studies from conventional residential buildings. Concentrations of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) with known permissible exposure limits were below levels known to cause chronic health effects, but their concentrations were inconclusive regarding cancer health effects due to relatively high detection limits. Although measured indoor air parameters met all IAQ maximum allowable concentrations in GBTC and applicable LEED requirements at the time of sampling, we argue that these measurements were not sufficient to assess IAQ comprehensively because more sensitive sampling/analytical methods for PM and VOCs are needed; in addition, there is a need for a formal process to ensure rigor and adequacy of sampling and analysis methods. Also, we suggest that a comprehensive IAQ assessment should include mixed mode thermal comfort models, semi-volatile organic compounds, assessment of new chemicals, and permissible exposure levels of many known indoor VOCs and bioaerosols. Plus, the relationship between energy consumption and IAQ, and tenant education on health effects of indoor pollutants and their sources may need more attention in IAQ investigations in green buildings.

Combined heat and power (CHP) offers a promising technological approach to achieving both goals. While a recent U.S. executive order set a national goal of 40. GW of new industrial CHP by 2020, the deployment of CHP is challenged by financial, regulatory, and workforce barriers. Discrepancies between private and public interests can be minimized by policies promoting energy-based economic development. In this context, a great deal of rhetoric has addressed the ambiguous goal of growing \"\"green jobs.\"\" Our research provides a systematic evaluation of the job impacts of an investment tax credit that would subsidize industrial CHP deployment. We introduce a hybrid analysis approach combining simulations using the National Energy Modeling System with Input-output modeling. NEMS simulates general-equilibrium effects including supply- and demand-side resources. We identify first-order employment impacts by creating \"\"bill of goods\"\" expenditures for the installation and operation of industrial CHP systems. Second-order impacts are then estimated based on the redirection of energy-bill savings accruing to consumers; these include jobs across the economy created by the lower electricity prices that would result from increased reliance on energy-efficient CHP systems. On a jobs-per-GWh basis, we find that the second-order impacts are approximately twice as large as the first-order impacts. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 Elsevier B.V.\"\\n\"Schneider A.G., Townsend-Small A., Rosso D.\",\"Impact of direct greenhouse gas emissions on the carbon footprint of water reclamation processes employing nitrification-denitrification\",2015,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84909606144&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2014.10.060&partnerID=40&md5=4f982d1faa1d7aae5fefcf48a409f9e5\",\"Water reclamation has the potential to reduce water supply demands from aquifers and more energy-intensive water production methods (e.g., seawater desalination). However, water reclamation via biological nitrification-denitrification is also associated with the direct emission of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) CO2, N2O, and CH4. We quantified these direct emissions from the nitrification-denitrification reactors of a water reclamation plant in Southern California, and measured the 14C content of the CO2 to distinguish between short- and long-lived carbon. The total emissions were 1.5 (\\xc2\\xb10.2) g-fossil CO2 m-3 of wastewater treated, 0.5 (\\xc2\\xb10.1) g-CO2-eq of CH4 m-3, and 1.8 (\\xc2\\xb10.5) g-CO2-eq of N2O m-3, for a total of 3.9 (\\xc2\\xb10.5) g-CO2-eqm-3.

From the 14C measurements, we found that between 11.4% and 15.1% of the CO2 directly emitted was derived from fossil sources, which challenges past assumptions that the direct CO2 emissions from water reclamation contain only modern carbon.

It was therefore considered desirable to reduce energy consumption and decrease the rate of depletion of world energy reserves and pollution of the environment. One way of reducing building energy consumption is to design building green, which is more economical in their use of energy.

Such a civilisation and economy may be supported by a community wide ecological value system, akin to corporate social responsibility, which integrates notions such as human well-being, fair sharing of wealth, social responsibility and inclusion, and respect for nature and its scarce resources.

This puzzling lag in technology adoption is holding back the role of agriculture for development in extensive regions of the world such as Sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern India, with high aggregate costs in terms of economic growth and human welfare. Field experiments have been particularly useful in addressing this adoption puzzle. Significant lessons have been learned on the roles of farmer behavior and of mediating factors such as credit, insurance, markets, and policies in constraining adoption. We use experimental field research in Eastern India to show that rainfed agriculture typically suffers from lack of effective supply of suitable HYVs, constraining adoption and resulting in low fertilizer use. Effective supply requires the existence of suitable HYVs (provided by research), the provision of information to farmers about these technologies (provided by extension services and social networks), and their local availability for adoption (provided by private agents in value chains). We consequently argue that solving the adoption puzzle for rainfed areas requires that governments and international donors increase investment in discovery-type agricultural research, support innovations in extension services, and promote the role of private agents in value chains. For donors this implies resolving a collective action problem in the provision of international public goods that remains pervasive. \\xc2\\xa9 De Boeck Sup\\xc3\\xa9rieur.

A major breakthrough was a 2012 Cluj-Napoca city council decision that a certified green building should receive a 50% local tax reduction. Since then all new buildings are LEED or BREEAM certified and lighting was one of the parts were buildings received a lot of points or credits. The sustainable lighting approach is the future oriented solution. It includes all the aspects not only technical or energy efficient ones and for this we need to rethink lighting from a broader perspective.\"\\n\"Alexander K.\",\"Capital markets union from the perspective of the bankingindustry and prudential supervision\",2015,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010461563&doi=10.1080%2f17521440.2015.1084560&partnerID=40&md5=a33d9b893c8d1ae27cfba2e990443c22\",\"This article analyses some of the issues related to the financial stability risks associated with the European Commission\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Green Paper on Capital Markets Union (CMU). The CMU proposal offers the potential for a more balanced and efficient provision of credit in EU capital markets through non-bank financial intermediaries that should enhance economic growth in Europe. Nonetheless, it introduces certain macroprudential regulatory risks that raise serious challenges for how EU policymakers plan to regulate the wholesale capital markets and particularly the shadow banking sector, which if not adequately addressed could substantially limit the effectiveness of the CMU project. The article suggests that the Commission has further work to do to ensure that the CMU addresses the macroprudential financial risks posed by bank disintermediation and the related systemic risks in the wholesale capital markets. \\xc2\\xa9 2016, Taylor and Francis Ltd.

In this scheme, countries can purchase certified emission reduction (CER) credits, each equivalent to one tonne of avoided emissions, to meet part of their emission reduction commitments. The CER credits are generated from emission reduction activities that are undertaken in developing countries. Although the CDM has benefited several sectors, the building sector hitherto accounts for a meagre proportion of the globally registered CDM initiatives. However, recent research suggests that there is potential in using the CDM concept to address carbon emissions associated with buildings. Further to this suggestion, this paper presents a demonstration of how the CDM concept could be applied to building projects in a developing country, Uganda. A two-bedroom residential house was considered as the unit of analysis and carbon emissions associated with constructing its walls were derived, considering materials, plant, and workforce used. Two options for the house were considered: a baseline (i.e. constructed using typical materials, plant, and labour) and green alternative (i.e. constructed using provisions to reduce carbon emissions). The difference in carbon emissions in the two options was found to constitute a basis for a CDM whose structure is presented and discussed in this paper. Considering a bottom-up projection regarding construction of residential houses in Uganda, the findings show that using the CDM concept, carbon emissions reduction of over 200 ktCO2 could be achieved in a period of 10 years. These figures were found comparable with prevailing CDM initiatives which are not associated with buildings. The overall findings indicated that extending the CDM concept to building projects is plausible and could promote market-based mechanisms of enhancing sustainable construction.\"\\n\"Reddy V.B., Al Bisher K., Haq Abdul Samad K.A., Bamadhaf M.O., Arunachalam S.\",\"Achieving sustainable zero flaring through spiking gas compressor at ADCO field\",2015,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84979870826&partnerID=40&md5=65ed8a481a17f9aa3e4de0fdf52521bb\",\"Gas flaring is a major source of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions and impacts public health due to release of harmful pollutants. Gas flaring from oil and gas industry contributes to 1.5 % of the global GHG emissions. As part of efforts to improve the environmental performance, ADCO commissioned spiking gas compressors to recover the flared gas and avoid emissions to atmosphere. The associated gas from one of the mid-eastern field is spiked into main oil line until such time as the new Gas plant is fully stabilised. The compressor train consists of reciprocating three-stage compressor, knock-out drum, air-cooler to cool down the compressed gas, metering skid, and glycol Dehydration Package. Adopting spiking compressor in middle-eastern field provided substantial economic and environmental benefits to the UAE in general and ADNOC/ADCO in particular. In addition to recovery of 98% flared gas, the project resulted in reduction of CO2 and improved the local air quality in the area. The project was registered under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2013 to claim carbon credits. Implementation of this project demonstrates the commitment of ADNOC Group towards climate change mitigation and sustainability. The paper details the technical features of the project, the environmental, economic, and social benefits associated with recovery of associated flared gas, and the CDM registration process adopted to claim actual carbon credits.

Rather than reducing poverty and promoting equality, development in and around the conservation area has in fact resulted in the disenfranchisement of local subsistence farmers and their communities, and the expropriation of their land, water, knowledge, and labour. Drawing on a decade of fieldwork in these communities, Isla exposes the duplicity of a neoliberal model in which the environment is converted into commercial assets such as carbon credits, intellectual property, cash crops, open-pit mines, and ecotourism, the consequences of which are often more detrimental than beneficial to the local populations. \\xc2\\xa9 University of Toronto Press 2015.\"\\n\"Hijazi M., Sheehan M.H., Fosbenner J., Kim H.\",\"Re-thinking daylighting spot measurements\",2015,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84966534402&partnerID=40&md5=348215b1e7202ff5389587c953d93acd\",\"Lighting is known as one of the major energy consumers in U.S. commercial buildings. To reduce the use of artificial lights in buildings, the existing green building rating systems such as Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design for Existing Buildings: Operations & Maintenance (LEED EBOM) include a credit that requires a building to demonstrate that at least 50% of total floor areas utilize daylighting based on field measurements. However, the field measurements are often based on spot measurements of illuminance levels, which do not easily track dynamic responses of lighting measurements. Therefore, to examine the validity of lighting spot measurements, this study performed spot and continuous measurements of daylight illuminance levels as well as an occupant questionnaire survey regarding daylighting conditions of a university building in Washington, D.C. The case-study building was recently certified under LEED 2009 EBOM, including an Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) credit 2.4 by demonstrating over 50% of the building?s floor areas achieved daylight illuminance levels over 25 foot-candles (fc). Based on this, the building installed an automatic shut-off switch of the lamps in daylight areas from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. during the spring and summer months and from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. during the fall and winter months. According to illuminance measurements and occupant questionnaire survey, it was found that the current lighting conditions of the building did not provide proper illuminance levels or visual comfort throughout the daylight spaces based on the values (i.e., 30 fc) provided by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA). In addition, occupants expressed dissatisfaction with their visual comfort. This indicates that the current rating systems should reconsider the existing lighting spot measurement protocols by providing methods to collect and analyze dynamic responses of lighting measurements.\"\\n\"Vijay Babu A.R., Srinivasa Rao G., Manoj Kumar P., Saranu S., Srihari Babu A., Uma Ch., Rao M., Ravi Teja A.J.R.\",\"Energy and Green house gas Payback Time analysis of an Air Breathing Fuel Cell stack\",2015,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962526517&partnerID=40&md5=6d883489256f693f67e7023d4e172f28\",\"Energy generation using fuel cells offers the possibility of high conversion efficiency and reduced pollution. An assessment of the environmental impact of fuel cells over the entire lifecycle is needed to determine the specific benefits in various application scenarios. Life cycle energy consumption and green house gas emission assessment must include a \"\"cradle to grave\"\" approach encompassing materials/manufacturing processes, fuel production, fuel compression and disposal/recycling. This paper deals with the analysis of Energy Payback Time (EPBT) and Green house gas Payback Time (GPBT) of anAir Breathing Fuel Cell (ABFC) stack, by estimating the embodied energy consumption and green house gas emissions within the whole lifecycle of the stack from the extraction of primary resources to the deployment including the manufacturing, usage and disposal phases. This analysis would be a useful tool for industry and government in estimating energy savings and environmental credits, and providing a holistic understanding on regulatory needs. In this paper, the life cycle energy consumption of a fabricated 100W ABFC Stack is found to be 313.7204 kWh, its Energy payback time (EPBT) is found to be 1.283 years (i.e., the time taken for the stack to generate the same amount of energy required for its life cycle which includes the energy requirement during its manufacturing, operation and disposal phases.) and the corresponding life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and Greenhouse gas payback time (GPBT) are found to be 103.14 kg CO2eq and 0.52 years accordingly.

Such claims use a variety of different approaches: on- and off-site renewable energy technologies, purchasing green energy credits, etc. Efforts have subsequently been directed at formulating clear definitions of net-zero that provide some degree of clarity and theoretical framing. The emerging notion of net-positive energy buildings raises new theoretical and practical issues and introduces several new design considerations and possibilities. Net-positive energy is explored though viewing the role of a building for adding value to its context and systems in which it is part. Rather than considering only the generation of more exported energy versus its importation to individual buildings or the grid, the emphasis shifts to the maximization of energy performance in a system-based approach. Net-positive energy approaches open a host of new technical, behavioural, policy, and regulatory issues and opportunities not currently evident with net-zero energy buildings. These challenge the primacy of individual buildings as the most effective unit to make significant energy gains and the current prevalent expectation that each and every new building should be required to attain net-zero performance. More generally, it highlights the importance of extending the systems limits of energy analysis. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 Taylor & Francis.\"\\n\"Srinivasan S.\",\"Green electricity: Credence purchases, risky credit sales and an honourable amount of fraud\",2015,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84961185798&doi=10.1504%2fIJGE.2015.075142&partnerID=40&md5=109a72ce619f2d15949ddb3db6508b85\",\"The credence quality of green electricity purchased by utilities at premium prices in recognition of the environmental characteristic is discussed.

Periodic state verification helps confirm the characteristics of electricity production at discrete points in time, yet leaving ample opportunity for the vendors to \\'round-trip\\' utility power, or to pass off \\'grey\\' electricity as \\'green\\' electricity, garnering higher earnings. Such deception is often sought to be justified on the grounds of the interest costs incurred on delayed receipts from the utility, and as an internal insurance mechanism against the potential risk of eventual default.

Issues such as storage and collection of recyclables, waste management planning, PBT source reduction, sourcing of raw materials, material ingredients, and design for flexibility that are treated in this category are difficult to implement in developing countries, mainly because they are based on local practices.

Over the course of six years, a green roof weighing lysimeter experiment at Villanova University has shown that approximately 70%-85% of rainfall from April to November each year goes to ET. Other studies have shown similar performance. Despite evidence that ET is significant, a model that can be easily and effectively used for planning and design is still elusive. In developing a planning model, incorporating a true physical representation of system processes must be balanced with ease of use, including procuring input data. The Hargreaves model is an empirical model used to predict potential evapotranspiration and is considered relatively accurate for longer time periods (several days) in the agricultural community. While other physical based models require many inputs, the Hargreaves model simply needs daily temperature, which is easily procured, as well as terrestrial radiation, which is calculated from latitude and time of year. Using water availability as a limiting factor, the Hargreaves model is adjusted to account for available soil moisture within the system. A simple accounting system that uses easily obtained design values (e.g. roof area and media characteristics), historical rainfall and calculated ET values is used to estimate the water availability of the system at any given point throughout the year as well as potential runoff from a storm event. Preliminary data from this modified Hargreaves model closely matched the six years of observed ET from the Villanova weighing lysimeter with an average percent error of 8%. The simplicity of this model could prove to be an effective planning tool for green roof designs in the future as well as an easier way to credit green roofs for their stormwater runoff reduction potential. \\xc2\\xa9 2015 ASCE.\"\\n\"Swaroopa S., Sravani A., Jain P.K.\",\"Comparison of mechanistic characteristics of cold, mild warm and half warm mixes for bituminous road construction\",2015,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84926034105&partnerID=40&md5=a8f31267c0cf4e515f26d3755dc83e9a\",\"Hot mix asphalt (HMA) is used for construction and maintenance of bituminous roads in India. These mixes are prepared, laid and compacted at fairly high temperatures requiring high energy input. Higher green house gas (GHG) emissions in hot mix technologies are issues of concern and reasons of the quest among the researchers for development of low energy and environment friendly cold and warm mixes, involving use of cationic bitumen emulsion as binder. These are considered as sustainable alternative to hot mix asphalt, which have gained prominence due to their use for construction of rural roads. Cold mix asphalt (CMA) is compacted and laid at ambient temperatures. A mix compacted at 70-90\\xc2\\xb0C temperature is known as half warm mix asphalt (HWMA). In the present study, a new type of mix named as mild warm mix asphalt (MWMA) is developed, where mix is compacted at 50\\xc2\\xb0C instead of 70 to 90\\xc2\\xb0C. This can be prepared, laid and compacted at 50-60\\xc2\\xb0C, which saves energy and also contributes to carbon credit in road construction. This paper reports findings of a comparative study on laboratory performance of CMA, MWMA and HWMA. Performance tests such as indirect tensile strength, indirect tensile strength ratio, dynamic creep, beam fatigue and resilient modulus at different temperatures and rutting resistance by wheel tracking test at 45\\xc2\\xb0C are conducted. Results of laboratory performance indicate that MWMA is better than CMA and comparable with HWMA. \\xc2\\xa9 2015, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

Five green ratings systems representative of aspects of a multi-modal ferry facility had previously been selected and were used in a four step methodology to synthesize into a strategic decision making platform. This current research focuses on how to make more detailed decision making harmonization amongst the credits in the rating systems. Using an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) of the credits in the rating systems, it was determined that the two main groups of information that could be used for harmonization were key intents or goals (KI) and key strategies or practices (KS). A short cursory case study example of how these KIs and KSs might be further cross-coded in an open database with the credit subcategories and corresponding rating systems is also presented.

Recently, heterogeneous network on chip (NoC) has been proposed not only to achieve performance comparable to that of the NoCs with buffered routers but also to reduce buffer cost and energy consumption. However, heterogeneous NoC design for heterogeneous GPU-CPU architectures has not been studied in depth. This paper first evaluates the performance and power consumption of a variety of static hot-potato based heterogeneous NoCs with different buffered and bufferless router placements, which is helpful to explore the design space for heterogeneous GPU-CPU interconnection. Then it proposes Unidirectional Flow Control (UFC), a simple credit-based flow control mechanism for heterogeneous NoC in GPU-CPU architectures to control network congestion. UFC can guarantee that there are always unoccupied entries in buffered routers to receive flits coming from adjacent bufferless routers. Our evaluations show that when compared to hot-potato routing, UFC improves performance by an average of 14.1% with energy increased by an average of 5.3% only. \\xc2\\xa9 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.\"\\n\"Teles C.D., Ribeiro J.L.D., Tinoco M.A.C., Ten Caten C.S.\",\"Characterization of the adoption of environmental management practices in large Brazilian companies\",2015,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84920055175&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2014.08.048&partnerID=40&md5=69c094a15899d275fa059ab5b228ef6b\",\"Many studies in literature discuss the drivers to implementing environmental management systems and some of them appraise the characteristics of companies that are implementing these systems and related practices.

These systems commonly generate revenue by offsetting the purchased energy source (i.e. electric utility), however, there are additional opportunities that can enhance existing revenue streams or develop new revenue streams from these renewable and non-renewable onsite power generation sources.

In this context, an innovative methodology (officially recognized by WEC in 2009) is proposed to mitigate Global Warming by artificially enhancing earth\\'s Albedo. Such a methodology allows to quantify the maximum environmental benefit achievable through the installation of Albedo control technologies, as a function of the geographical features of the installation site, local meteorological conditions, radiative properties, tilt angle, and orientation of the surfaces. This benefit is directly quantified in terms of CO2eq offset. Albedo control can be an effective mitigation strategy by means of three synergistic effects: a direct contribution towards Global Warming mitigation produced by an enhanced reflection to the space of the shortwave incident radiation; the indirect contribution from energy saving in buildings with high Albedo envelopes; the indirect contribution from the mitigation of Urban Heat Island phenomenon.

If green-certified construction costs more than non-green construction, then is there a financial reason for not seeking a green rating. Do green buildings perform better than non-green buildings financially? The paper develops and presents a discounted present valuemodel for doing a cost-benefit analysis for building green. This model enables an investor to determine the feasibility of constructing a new green-certified building instead of a conventional non-green building. Non-green buildings are not certified by a rating agency such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Energy Star or Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM). Real estate permits are granted by local municipalities in the USA. This means that local government mandates requiring green construction that significantly adds to the initial cost of a project could have the unintended result of encouraging new non-green construction just outside their municipal boundaries. Design/methodology/approach \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The paper collects publically available research data for office buildings located in the USA, and inputs this information into an income statement. It tests the hypothesis: is green-certified construction a financially feasible choice for an investor? An incremental approach using a 15-year holding period is presented. This time period takes into account equipment wear and tear. Heating/cooling systems and other green-technologically based operating systems have a limited life and do not last for 30 or 40 years. They are likely to need replacement after 15 years have lapsed. Findings \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The negative net present value (NPV) results and high payback periods indicate that increased rents for green construction, a tax credit for the present value loss and/or property-tax reduction covering the shortfall is needed as an incentive to commercially build green. The implication of a negative NPV is that green office buildings will be built by government agencies where green is mandated, corporations that want a green image and benefit from this image, where local ordinances mandate green construction features and where local and federal tax incentives are available increasing a construction project\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feasibility. Research limitations/implications \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The limitation of any cost-benefit study is that analytical models and/or data used to forecast energy and water consumption savings in green-certified buildings compared to conventional buildings can be inaccurate. Forecasting models can understate or overstate the actual savings realized from green construction especially in the long-term given the difficulty of predicting equipment wear and tear, net rents and energy costs. The modeled percentage cost associated with green new construction features could remain constant or grow through time. Tables I and II results assume energy and water expenses remain a constant percentage over the 15-year period. The agency costs associated with obtaining a LEED or BREEAM certification was not calculated as an upfront cost. Certification by LEED or BREEAM increases the upfront cost associated with building a green building. Practical implications \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The length of the payback period estimates coupled with negative NPV for green certified compared to non-green construction suggests that developers do not have an incentive to build green. Higher WACC rates would result in green-certified projects being less feasible to build. Social implications \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The LEED certification point system may need to be reviewed. Points are assigned for features that improve occupant satisfaction, but may have little impact on reducing energy usage. Originality/value \\xe2\\x80\\x93 A model is presented for determining whether green-certified construction is financially feasible. The model enables the investor to determine the size of a tax incentive that is needed to enable new green construction to be economically feasible to build. The higher the negative NPV the larger the income or property tax incentive or other financial incentives needed. Prior research studies compared green and non-green buildings, but did not compare the energy savings generated to the additional construction and upfront costs incurred using a discount rate. They assumed the energy savings justified the additional initial cost associated with building a new green certified. \\xc2\\xa9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\"\\n\"Ozcan D.C., Alonso M., Ahn H., Abanades J.C., Brandani S.\",\"Process and cost analysis of a biomass power plant with in situ calcium loopingCO2 capture process\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84903795960&doi=10.1021%2fie500606v&partnerID=40&md5=6de5d2a19fe6ef5f481255ce5eda9065\",\"A novel concept is presented to capture CO2 from a large-scale (&gt;100 MWe) dedicated biomass-fired power plant by using CaO as the CO2 sorbent. Biomass is burnt in a circulating fluidized bed at sufficiently low temperature to allow in situ CO2 capture at atmospheric pressure. The product, CaCO3, is then calcined in an interconnected oxy-fuel combustor, or calciner, that delivers CO2 ready for subsequent purification, compression, and permanent geological storage. A detailed process analysis using Honeywell\\'s UniSim R400 is carried out to reveal process performance and economics of the proposed power plant which is compared against biomass-air-fired and biomass-oxy-fired power plants. A heat exchanger network is designed using a pinch analysis aimed at the recovery of the maximum amount of excess heat from high temperature gas and solid streams in the plant, while the recovered heat is transferred into a subcritical steam cycle for power generation. The entire process simulation also includes a CO2 purification and compression unit that allows reaching more than 95 mol % CO2 purity. The close similarity of the system with commercial coal based CFB power plants enables us to evaluate costs of electricity and CO2 avoided in detail. This process is capable of achieving 84% overall CO2 capture efficiency with additional cost of 43 \\xe2\\x82\\xac/ton CO2 avoided excluding green certificate and European Trading Scheme (ETS) CO2 incentives. If current typical values for these subsidies are included, the avoided cost can even take negative values. The biomass-air-fired plant becomes the most attractive option when only green certificates are introduced. The biomass-oxy-fired and in situ calcium looping plants largely improve their economics when ETS price for CO2 credits increases. The in situ calcium looping option becomes slightly more economical and more flexible to adapt to different market conditions affecting the economic incentives to use biomass for power generation when the biomass plant is colocated with an oxy-fired coal power plant. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 American Chemical Society.\"\\n\"Guan B., Wu J., Wang Y., Khan S.U.\",\"CIVSched: A communication-aware inter-VM scheduling technique for decreased network latency between co-located VMs\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84908394684&doi=10.1109%2fTCC.2014.2328582&partnerID=40&md5=faa737213e4e0656703229d5d051b26c\",\"Server consolidation in cloud computing environments makes it possible for multiple servers or desktops to run on a single physical server for high resource utilization, low cost, and reduced energy consumption. However, the scheduler in the virtual machine monitor (VMM), such as Xen credit scheduler, is agnostic about the communication behavior between the guest operating systems (OS). The aforementioned behavior leads to increased network communication latency in consolidated environments. In particular, the CPU resources management has a critical impact on the network latency between co-located virtual machines (VMs) when there are CPU- and I/O-intensive workloads running simultaneously. This paper presents the design and implementation of a communication-aware inter-VM scheduling (CIVSched) technique that takes into account the communication behavior betweeninter-VMs running on the same virtualization platform. The CIVSched technique inspects the network packets transmitted between local co-resident domains to identify the target VM and process that will receive the packets.

Today\\'s economy has seen an explosion of new forms of monetary exchange not created by the federal government. Credit card companies offer points that can be traded in for a variety of goods and services, from airline miles to online store credit. Online game creators have devised new mediums of electronic exchange that turn virtual money into real money. Meanwhile, real money is increasingly going digital, where it competes with private currencies like Bitcoin. The virtual and the real economic worlds are intermingling more than ever before, raising the possibility that this new money might eventually replace the government-run system of dollars, euros, and yen. Edward Castronova is the leading researcher in this field, a founder of scholarly online game studies and an expert on the economies of virtual worlds. In this dynamic and essential work, he explores the current phenomenon of virtual currencies and what it will mean legally, politically, and economically in the future. In doing so, he provides a fascinating, often surprising discourse on the meaning of money itself-what it is, what we think it is, and how we relate to it on an emotional level. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 by Edward Castronova.

This paper analyzed the definition, scope, evolution and main instruments of EFPs. The implementation progress of financial activities on each instrument are investigated respectively. Then the experiences learned from and failures discovered in the development of the EFPs are discussed well recommendations for further improvement of the EFPs and their implementation are provided. Our study found that the EFPs have been established in China after a four-phase evolution since the early 1980s. The policies have played a critical role in leading to a rapid development in environmental finance by involving more financial instruments to accomplish the objective-led environmental plans. Driven by the policies, the new green credit (GC), green security (GS), and green insurance (GI) instruments have been phased in as supplements to the conventional command and control approaches to improve the environmental governance of financial activities and pollution sources. However, the market mechanism of financial institution is limited due to their defensive and incapable performance on implementation some of EFP instruments. To further strengthen the effectiveness of EFPs in facilitating environmental management, recommendations are made mainly on the aspects including developing more specific policy guidelines, enhancing information sharing and disclosure, providing sufficient economic incentives, establishing environmental liabilities with financial activities, and involving issues related to climate change, and biodiversity and ecosystem service. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\"\\n\"Solomon S.\",\"Sugarcane Agriculture and Sugar Industry in India: At a Glance\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893785919&doi=10.1007%2fs12355-014-0303-8&partnerID=40&md5=34c0d7ec5615f1e5a43b87e22ab20729\",\"The Indian sugar industry plays a leading role in global sugar market, it being the world\\'s second largest producer after Brazil producing nearly 15 and 25 % of global sugar and sugarcane, respectively. It is a significant contributor to the socio-economic development of the nation. The sugar industry which encompasses 597 operating sugar mills, 309 distilleries and 213 cogeneration plant and numerous pulp, paper and chemical making units is supported by four leading sugarcane research institutions, 22 state sugarcane research stations, world class sugar machinery manufacturers, suppliers and technical experts. The area under sugarcane hovers around 5 million ha which is nearly 3 % of the gross cultivable area in the country, the industry produces around 300-350 MT cane, 23-25 MT white sugar and 6-8 MT jaggery and khandsari to meet the domestic requirement of sweeteners. Besides, about 2.9 billion litres of alcohol and 2,330 MW power and many chemicals are also produced. The industry is able to export around 1,300 MW of power to the grid. Indian sugar industry is fully capable of meeting demand of potable alcohol as well as 10 % blending in gasoline. The industry is gradually transforming into sugar complexes by producing sugar, bio-electricity, bio-ethanol, bio-manure and chemicals; these contribute about 1.1 % to the national GDP. Currently, the turnover of the sugarcane and sugar related economic activities is in the range of Rs. 80-85 thousand crores per annum, out of which around Rs. 55-60 thousand crores accrues to the sugarcane farmers of the country. Emerging businesses like fuel ethanol, raw sugar and structural changes in global market have provided new horizons for the Indian sugar industry. The sector today has transformational opportunities that would enable it not only to continue to serve the largest domestic markets but has also to emerge as a significant carbon credit and green power producer, with the potential to support an ethanol blending programme of E10 and beyond. The contribution of these activities to the turnover of the industry at the moment is around Rs. 10-12 thousand crores which is likely to increase substantially in imminent future. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 Society for Sugar Research &#38; Promotion.\"\\n\"Corsatea T.D., Giaccaria S., Ar\\xc3\\xa1ntegui R.L.\",\"The role of sources of finance on the development of wind technology\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84890813540&doi=10.1016%2fj.renene.2013.11.063&partnerID=40&md5=f3b3ab0bbe2d9467ee162415437f1969\",\"This paper contributes to the debate on the competitiveness and maturity of wind technology by carrying out an analysis on research investments and sales of a panel of 10 wind manufacturers over the period 2002-2011, examining the extent to which public and private funding affect the competitiveness of these wind corporations. A group of major manufacturers of wind turbines with production in 2006 totaling more than 70% of the global supplied capacities is considered a representative cluster of green innovative industry for this study. Public support for research, development and demonstration (RD&D), incentives for the production of wind energy and access to credit are the three main sources of finance addressed herein. Corporate debt is the primary factor supporting both wind technology research investment and sales of wind turbines, whereas other sources of finance play a limited role. The reduction in that source of finance has important repercussions for the development of wind energy. The econometric analysis suggests that regulatory risks play a key role for the development of wind technology, even stronger than the financial risk. Thee former originate in unexpected decisions to stop subsidies (e.g. deployment ones), whereas the latter arise from restrictive access to credit. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\"\\n\"Nuyun L., Jinliang L.\",\"China\\'s green climate fund: Innovation and experience: A case study of the China Green Carbon Foundation\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928194112&doi=10.1163%2f9789004274648_011&partnerID=40&md5=d98558c0d602b23f5c4a8cc1a4fdb696\",\"The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was officially founded at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Durban Conference as a tool to assist developing countries mitigate climate change and adapt to its effects. Durban leaves operations of the GCF undecided, and the international community lacks successful experience to guide interested countries. As a pioneer of China\\'s GCF, the China Green Carbon Foundation (CGCF) is the first nationwide non-profit public foundation dedicated to carbon sequestration, emissions reduction, and addressing climate change. The CGCF is a competent professional organization implementing carbon offsets and carbon neutral projects in China by employing measures such as afforestation projects to sequester carbon and forest protection to reduce carbon emissions. The CGCF has created an integrated public service platform to help enterprises and the public to realize its four main objectives: storing carbon credits, fulfilling social responsibilities, increasing farmers\\' income, and improving the ecological environment through forestry measures. The CGCF has actively explored ways to innovate its operational model, standard development, project management, carbon trading, scientific research, publicity, and promotion and engages in a novel form of public foundation operations matching enterprise donations for afforestation with corporate social responsibility, carbon credit storage, and voluntary emission reductions. This model has provided a new effective path for businesses and the public to participate in addressing climate change. This paper elaborates on the CGCF innovative practices over the past five years including its operational model, successful projects, and practical experience, and proposes public foundations as important actors in combating climate change. It provides effective reference models and experiences for the Durban GCF operations and management, which promote healthy development toward the GCF\\'s set goals. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 by Koninklijke Brill nv, Leiden, The Netherlands.

There is, therefore, currently a weak financial rationale and a limited choice of tools to assess the materiality of environmental risk for the sovereign bond market. Improving investor understanding of the materiality of environmental risks is likely to be crucial to limiting risk exposure of important investments and to encouraging the transition to a greener more sustainable economy. This article presents the development and initial application of a framework that aims to improve the financial rationale for assessing the materiality of environmental risk in the sovereign bond market. It is the result of a collaborative and inter-disciplinary project of researchers and practitioners from a group of financial institutions, the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative, and Global Footprint Network. Results not only show the long- and short-term implications of environmental risk for a wide variety of resource profiles, but also how these risks relate to macroeconomic factors that are already recognised as relevant to sovereign credit risk. This, therefore, presents a more accurate reflection of how these factors might influence the risk or return situation for an investor. More collaborative and innovative research between scientists and practitioners could improve both knowledge and methods to effectively account for the financial materiality of natural resource risks for a country\\'s economy. \\xc2\\xa9 2013, \\xc2\\xa9 2013 Taylor & Francis.\"\\n\"Kauffman S., Droogers P., Hunink J., Mwaniki B., Muchena F., Gicheru P., Bindraban P., Onduru D., Cleveringa R., Bouma J.\",\"Green Water Credits-exploring its potential to enhance ecosystem services by reducing soil erosion in the Upper Tana basin, Kenya\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84902966662&doi=10.1080%2f21513732.2014.890670&partnerID=40&md5=7b1f9d92677776fe0a8cac624b8cf40b\",\"Food production, water availability and energy production are important ecosystem services of the Upper Tana basin (Kenya) and they decline due to upstream erosion affecting downstream water users. The effect of 11 soil conservation measures on soil erosion and the three ecosystem services was estimated by a modelling approach to assess agro-ecological processes and benefit/cost relations. Soil water available for evaporation and transpiration (green water) functioned as a unifying concept to express the effects of erosion and the impacts of soil and water conservation measures that result in: (1) increased water availability for crops; (2) increased fluxes towards aquifers, thereby increasing water supply and regulating streamflow, and (3) a reduction of erosion and siltation of reservoirs used for hydroelectricity. Modelling indicated that the three ecosystem services could be improved, as compared with the base level, by up to 20% by introducing appropriate conservation measures with benefit/cost relations of around 7. However, farmers were unable to make the necessary investments and much effort and many institutional studies were needed to achieve progress towards implementation by initiating the Green Water Credits (GWC) programme intended to arrange payments by downstream businesses to upstream farmers. A timeline analysis is presented to illustrate the slow, but persistent, development of transdisciplinary activities as a function of time using connected value development as a guiding principle. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 Taylor and Francis.\"\\n\"Mukherjee S., Ghosh P.B.\",\"Estimation of carbon credit and direct carbon footprint by solar photovoltaic cells in West Bengal, India\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84894339028&doi=10.1093%2fijlct%2fcts053&partnerID=40&md5=9f7113fe1570e5d1f16899e6dbde58e0\",\"Presently, India is almost dependent on coal-based energy, which leads to the generation of a considerable amount of CO2. In the context of climate change, solar energy is accepted as an important alternative source of energy as it is green energy. But the single crystal silicon cells, which are the starting material for solar energy, are produced in exchange of greenhouse gas, the carbon dioxide. Present article highlights an estimation of solar energy production and carbon credit (CC) earning by the photovoltaic cells of mono-crystalline silicon in a definite module, largely used in West Bengal, India. In addition, the quantity of silicon required for the preparation of this module as well as its equivalent amount of carbon dioxide generation during the extraction from quartzite sand by the Czocharlski\\' technique has been calculated. This analysis is based on the experimental and theoretical performance of the system. The study reveals that, on considering average light intensity (4.5 kWh) for 10h/day, the power output of this solar module is 0.60 kWh/m2/day. CC earned is computed as 0.33 tonnes/MWh/year, under West Bengal climatic condition as per the norms of the Kyoto protocol. For obtaining 11.86 kg of silicon, which is the raw material of soar cell used in this study, the amount of CO2 production is calculated as 8.70 kg/MWh/year. Considering 35 kg CO2/MWh as reference, this amount of CO2 production corresponds to 25% of the total carbon footprint. \\xc2\\xa9 The Author 2012.

These include escalation of energy costs, heightened awareness about acceptable IAQ, aging of the commercial building inventory, numerous revisions and addenda to ventilation standards and building codes, and green building/sustainability initiatives and energy tax credits. A field study was performed on established installations of particulate and gas-phase filtration in and around Atlanta, Georgia (USA), and included a variety of building types and usage and evaluated environmental conditions and airborne contaminants. The study was undertaken in two parts with Phase I being to establish and finalize test and measurement protocols and a Phase II for field investigation. This paper provides a summary of both Phases, including characteristics of untreated outdoor air, and air cleaning with particulate filters and gas-phase air filtration. Overall, there was a TVOC reduction of 38-74 %, 0.5 \\xce\\xbcm particulate removal efficiency of 28-95 %, and an ozone removal efficiency of 100 %. Each building had annual operational cost savings ranging between US$10,000 and US$800,000. The field study is intended to establish the parameters of dilution air compared with similar characteristics of air treated with particulate and gas-phase filtration. The field study demonstrated that filtered air can meet or exceed the IAQ level from simple dilution with outdoor air. The study also documents the comparable energy savings as a result of a reduction in outdoor air ventilation rates and significant control of specific contaminants of concern regarding occupant safety and building security. \\xc2\\xa9 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.\"\\n[No author name available],\"2013 2nd International Conference on Civil Engineering and Material Engineering, CEME 2013\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84891894150&partnerID=40&md5=98322ba8054e882d067411606ee3f1ff\",\"The proceedings contain 125 papers.

Since C02 is the dominant greenhouse gas, these are generally referred to as Carbon gas. In order to save the world from global warming, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in 1992 and Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997 as a follow up measure, which came into force from 2005. Kyoto Protocol fixed ceilings on the emission of green house gases (GHGs) by the developed countries. These countries have set limits to GHG emissions by their own industries and others. The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EUETS) is the main pillar of the European Union in meeting its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. Three market based mechanisms have been designed to encourage the reduction of green house emissions, which are (1) Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), (2) Joint Implementation (JI), (3) International Emission Trading (IET). The developed countries which are bound to reduce their emissions can discharge their commitments by purchasing the Carbon Emission Reduction entitlements (CERs) from the other countries which have implemented green house gas reduction projects. The CERs or carbon credits are traded in the international and Indian commodity exchanges at market determined prices. In India, Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) has become the first Asian exchange to trade in carbon credits. It has been reported that about 300 Indian companies are already trading in carbon credits in MCX. This study analyses the factors which can affect carbon trading and hence, the future green house gas emission. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 Asian Network for Scientific Information.\"\\n\"Garc\\xc3\\xada-Alvarado M.S., Paquet M., Chaabane A.\",\"Inventory control and environmental policies\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84983196132&partnerID=40&md5=c3d8cd8d32c723d91348b38bcd516812\",\"Current environmental regulations and economic conditions force organizations to limit Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Since inventories have proven their crucial role in supply chains, the aim of this paper is to study the impact of inventory control in reducing the environmental damage of an organization. Modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we dealt with a stochastic recovery inventory system considering an infinite-horizon, and a cap-and-trade mechanism. In numerical examples, we compute optimum replenishment remanufacturing and manufacturing quantities, and characterize the structure of the optimal inventory policy. We show that there is a direct link between carbon credit price and inventory policies. Moreover, there is a carbon credit price from which the organization prefers to lost sales than to invest in carbon credits. Ultimately, we extend our results towards a finite-horizon context, and discuss the impact of environmental strategies in replenishment decisions.\"\\n\"Martinez-Hernandez E., Martinez-Herrera J., Campbell G.M., Sadhukhan J.\",\"Process integration, energy and GHG emission analyses of Jatropha-based biorefinery systems\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978025362&doi=10.1007%2fs13399-013-0105-3&partnerID=40&md5=7c9e8b43c1dd4adf0014e6a14607bc4c\",\"Driven by the need to develop a wide variety of products with low environmental impact, biorefineries need to emerge as highly integrated facilities. This becomes effective when overall mass and energy integration through a centralised utility system design is undertaken. An approach combining process integration, energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission analyses is shown in this paper for Jatropha biorefinery design, primarily producing biodiesel using oil-based heterogeneously catalysed transesterification or green diesel using hydrotreatment. These processes are coupled with gasification of husk to produce syngas. Syngas is converted into end products, heat, power and methanol in the biodiesel case or hydrogen in the green diesel case. Anaerobic digestion of Jatropha by-products such as fruit shell, cake and/or glycerol has been considered to produce biogas for power generation. Combustion of fruit shell and cake is considered to provide heat. Heat recovery within biodiesel or green diesel production and the design of the utility (heat and power) system are also shown. The biorefinery systems wherein cake supplies heat for oil extraction and seed drying while fruit shells and glycerol provide power generation via anaerobic digestion into biogas achieve energy efficiency of 53 % in the biodiesel system and 57 % in the green diesel system. These values are based on high heating values (HHV) of Jatropha feedstocks, HHV of the corresponding products and excess power generated. Results showed that both systems exhibit an energy yield per unit of land of 83 GJ ha-1. The global warming potential from GHG emissions of the net energy produced (i.e. after covering energy requirements by the biorefinery systems) was 29 g CO2-eq MJ-1, before accounting credits from displacement of fossil-based energy by bioenergy exported from the biorefineries. Using a systematic integration approach for utilisation of whole Jatropha fruit, it is shown that global warming potential and fossil primary energy use can be reduced significantly if the integrated process schemes combined with optimised cultivation and process parameters are adopted in Jatropha-based biorefineries. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\"\\n\"Greyling L.\",\"From methane curse to carbon trading at gold fields\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84947575865&partnerID=40&md5=45609cf29626ae4db3cc33057ee21d99\",\"Gold Fields\\xe2\\x80\\x99 vision of being \\xe2\\x80\\x98the global leader in sustainable gold mining\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is a clear indicationof what strategic drivers have been identified to differentiate it from other gold miningcompanies.

LEED project consultants often attempt to maximize the number of credit points to be achieved strategically with limited budgets and resources. For example, some green building technologies and features can be used to achieve multiple credits with little additional effort. Therefore, some applicants have studied the relationship and similarity in scope among the credits in green building rating systems, thereby finding ways to achieve multiple related credits. Some green building guides, such as the official LEED reference guide, also give suggestions on related credits. However, there has been a lack of study testing the strength of these suggestions. This paper aims to evaluate the strength of these suggested relationships by using data mining techniques. A database of certified green building projects was constructed based on the data from the USGBC website. The credits achieved by these projects were analyzed using association rule mining techniques. The strength of the suggested credit rules were identified according to the calculated outcomes. The results show that some suggested credit rules are related and commonly co-occur. \\xc2\\xa9 ASCE 2014.\"\\n\"Marzouk M., Metawie M.\",\"Framework for sustainable low-income housing projects in Egypt\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84934324511&doi=10.1061%2f9780784413616.243&partnerID=40&md5=281dfcec4614531c180a8d3158bb60dc\",\"Low income housing is one of the most important housing projects that are directed to serve low-income people in Egypt.

A building can obtain a Platinum, Gold, Silver or Certified grade based on the number of LEED credit points achieved. Selection of target credits is important and challenging for LEED managers due to limited budget, tight project schedule, and limited resources in many green building projects. Local climate factors like temperature can affect the selection of green building technologies and hence the LEED credits adopted. However, no research has been done to suggest LEED target credits based on climate factors. This paper aims to develop a decision support system based on climate factors for LEED credit selection using data mining techniques. The LEED for Existing Buildings version 2009 was focused in this study. Information of 912 certified green building projects and their surrounding climate circumstances was collected and studied. Classification models for 48 LEED credits that use credit achievement as the class and climate factors as the variables were then constructed and optimized using three data mining algorithms - Random Forests, AdaBoost Stumps and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results were incorporated in a web-based decision support system. A case study was then conducted to illustrate and evaluate the system. The results showed that our decision support system has a high accuracy. \\xc2\\xa9 ASCE 2014.\"\\n\"Cozzi M., DiNapoli F., Viccaro M., Fagarazzi C., Romano S.\",\"Ordered weight averaging multicriteria procedure and cost-effectiveness analysis for short rotation forestry in the Basilicata Region, Italy\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84923921657&doi=10.1504%2fijgei.2014.067671&partnerID=40&md5=1e4310b180e7359de4e2db9d512f950a\",\"Optimisation of bio-energy chains and the establishment of a bioenergy district can make a positive contribution to territorial development, while reducing environmental pollution.

Just two months later Fitch downgraded Greece\\xe2\\x80\\x99s debt to BBB+, the lowest credit rating in Europe. The Greek government tries to resolve this historical \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproblem\\xe2\\x80\\x9c with a loan from a troika (European Union, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund), which requires the country to implement a wide array of austerity measures, from spending cuts and public sector lay-offs to tax rises and the privatization of public assets. But the three-year crisis has left deep scars on the body of society, leaving thousands out of work and plunging them into poverty. According to the official data from the Greek ELSTAT statistic agency reports, unemployment in Greece hit a new record in October 2012 reaching 26,8 %, compared with 2008, when economic decline started in Greece, unemployment has more than tripled. In addition, according to study by ADEDY and GSEE labor unions, approximately one in two Greeks earns less than 4,871 \\xe2\\x82\\xac a year and lives below the poverty line, defined as the minimum income a family of four needs to eat, dress, use transportation, go to school, and pay the rent.Based on the data from the ministry of environment, energy and climate change the Greek government knows that the greatest problem of the Greek fuels market is fuel smuggling, adulteration and cheating, which lead to distortions in the market. In order to solve this problem the government decides to equalize the price of heating oil with petrol pump prices. However, this decision pushes the price of a litre of heating oil to around 1,3 \\xe2\\x82\\xac, about 45 % higher than one year ago. With petrol out of the question for the many, attention has turned to alternative forms of heating. On the other hand, collusion among producers in Greece and a thorough lack of competition that allows a favored few to extract economically unjustified profits have as a result the price of natural gas, wood and pellet to climb.The main goal of this work is to estimate the feasibility of a heat pump system as an alternative solution to the common heating diesel which is used in Greece. Based on the long-term meteorological data from 66 stations, the financial feasibility of a heat pump heating system at each site in Greece was estimated. The RETScreen Clean Energy Project Analysis software was used in order to carry out the feasibility analysis and the green house gas (GHG) emissions reductions. Generally Greece has a typical Mediterranean climate which means hot, dry summers and mild rainy winters with snow mainly at higher elevations. The facts that there aren\\'t areas in Greece which are more than 140 kilometers away from water and nearly 80 % of country is mountainous give varying weather patterns across to the country. According to the heating degree-days, Greece can be divided into 4 climatic zones. Sensitivity analysis was realized for four cities, namely Rhodes, Athens/Filadelpeia, Kavala and Kastoria, which are located in the first, second, third and fourth zone respectively. In accordance with the financial results in the first climatic zone where heating demand is really low, the replacement of heating oil systems with heat pump systems is not very profitable investment.In zone A, based on the results from the RETScreen, the payback period varies between 7\\xe2\\x80\\x9310,5 years, while for the poorest of citizens owing to government subsidy of 0,28\\xe2\\x82\\xac/l the payback period is between 9,8\\xe2\\x80\\x9314,5 years. In the second zone there are several financial benefits from using heat pump system instead of heating oil, the payback period fluctuates from 5,1 up to 6,9 years (without government grant) or from 7,3 up to 9,8 years (with government grant). In the climatic zone C, heat pump system seems provides considerable economic benefits, the relevant results showed that the payback period varies between 4,2\\xe2\\x80\\x935 or 6\\xe2\\x80\\x937,1 years without and with government subsidy. In the fourth climatic zone where the climate is similar with that in central Europe, heat pump system is a sound financial investment and the payback period is really short (3,2\\xe2\\x80\\x934,2 years without government grant or 4,6\\xe2\\x80\\x936,0 years with government grant). Last but not least, except from financial benefits, there are environmental benefits as well. Based on the RETScreen environmental analysis, the gross annual GHG emissions reduction was estimated to be 1,5 up to 5 tCO2. \\xc2\\xa9 2014, Kaunas University of Technology.

Simulations were performed to model the reduction in stormwater runoff by implementing bioretention on a typical residential property according to extant administrative rules. The EPA National Stormwater Calculator was used to perform pre- vs post-retrofit comparisons and to demonstrate its ease of use for possible use by other cities in utility planning. Although surface slope, soil type and infiltration rate, impervious area, and bioretention parameters were different across cities, our results suggest that modeled runoff volume was most sensitive to percent of total impervious area that drained to the bioretention cell, with soil type the next most important factor. Findings also indicate a persistent gap between the percentage of annual runoff reduced and the percentage of fee reduced. \\xc2\\xa9 US Environmental Protection Agency 2014\"\\n\"Lynch M.\",\"Achieving LEED credit for ergonomics: Laying the foundation\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84908569234&doi=10.3233%2fWOR-141874&partnerID=40&md5=2f349ee0b836d4bce7a576eef07ff0c0\",\"Despite guidance from the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) on the requirements for earning a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) ergonomics credit in the Innovation in Design and Innovation in Operations category, few projects have received the credit.

To gain a better understanding of the difference in greenhouse gas emissions of acetylated scots pine, tropical hardwood (azobe) and non-renewable materials (steel, concrete), this study first presents the emissions in terms of kg CO2 equivalent based on a cradle-to-gate scenario. Since the cradle-to-gate assessment excludes relevant use-phase and end-of-life related aspects, the second part of this study takes the production results as input for an assessment of the full life cycle (cradle-to-grave) with the bearing structure of a typical pedestrian bridge as fair unit of comparison for all material alternatives. The results show that acetylated wood has a considerably lower carbon footprint than steel, concrete and unsustainably sourced azobe, and slightly lower than sustainably sourced azobe. Because of the limited emissions during production and carbon credits related to carbon sequestration as a result of land-use change and bio-energy production during the end-of-life phase, all sustainably sourced wood alternatives, including acetylated wood, show CO2 negative LCA results over the full life cycle. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 WIT Press.\"\\n\"Wingfield A.\",\"Geosynthetics: The science that makes green roofs work\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84906066501&partnerID=40&md5=50a149b472253eb1201e1fa934010f5b\",\"Most green roofs use a variety of geosynthetic materials to support healthy and sustainable installations.

Because they are lightweight, they reduce green roofs\\' structural loading on buildings and also reduce the energy required for transportation and installation of green roof assembly components. Many geosynthetics can be made of recycled materials and using them can contribute to LEED credits. While the finished, and beautiful, vegetated field is what catches the eye in project photographs, the casual viewer may be unaware of the many layers of geosynthetics and other materials that contribute to the completed green roof.

It covers a number of categories, including Management, Indoor Environment Quality, Energy, Transport, Water, Materials, Land Use & Ecology, Emissions and Innovation. This paper reviews the use of the Green Star system in Australian education facilities construction and the potential challenges associated with Green Star- Education implementation. Score sheets of 34 education projects across Australia that achieved Green Star certification were collected and analyzed. The percentage of green star points obtained within each category and sub-category (credits) for each project were analyzed to illustrate the achievement of credits. The results show that management-related credits and ecology-related credits are the easiest and most difficult to obtain respectively. The study also indicted that 6 Green Star education projects obtained particularly high percentages in the Innovation category. The investigation of points obtained in each category provides prospective Green Star applicants with insights into credit achievement for future projects. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\"\\n\"Lyons K., Westoby P.\",\"Carbon colonialism and the new land grab: Plantation forestry in Uganda and its livelihood impacts\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84903526553&doi=10.1016%2fj.jrurstud.2014.06.002&partnerID=40&md5=c7ab3188f9679f968633a0b93a81af6c\",\"Private sector investment has become increasingly central to development in the global south, and in recent years these interventions have taken a \\'green\\' turn. This is demonstrated via investment in economic activities associated with environmental claims, including plantation forestry and carbon trading initiatives. Many of these green initiatives represent market-based responses to climate change that rely upon the implementation of mitigation strategies in the global south to offset industrial and polluting activities in the global north. In this paper we explore the activities of Green Resources, the largest plantation forestry operator on the African continent.Through an examination of the activities of Green Resources in Uganda, this paper argues that while private sector international investment in plantation forestry for carbon offsetting is widely supported as responding to the nation\\'s environmental crisis, it is part of a carbon colonialism and neoliberal land grab. There are profound adverse local livelihood outcomes that arise on the basis of this carbon colonialism. After discussing these themes in turn, this paper concludes that the commodification and fetishing of carbon via global carbon markets disconnects northern-based carbon credit consumers from adverse local livelihood impacts for those living in, and adjacent to, forestry plantations. These impacts point to the limits of north-south market-based green development interventions as solutions to climate change. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 .\"\\n\"Zhao J., Deng W., Song Y.\",\"Ridership and effectiveness of bikesharing: The effects of urban features and system characteristics on daily use and turnover rate of public bikes in China\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84903489995&doi=10.1016%2fj.tranpol.2014.06.008&partnerID=40&md5=9be04e91cb9edf1d3aedc87032fefc78\",\"As a pinnacle of green transportation with transit attributes, bikesharing has become particularly popular since the mid-2000s. Two crucial questions for the success of bikesharing adoption are how many riders can bikesharing attract, and what influences its effectiveness. To shed light on answers to these questions, this paper models the impacts of urban features and system characteristics on bikesharing daily use and turnover rate, using data constructed on 69 bikesharing systems in China. Prior to modeling, we provide an overview of bikesharing adoption in China, describing why they have been adopted, how they have matured, and how they have expanded. Results from data regression and comparison indicate that bikesharing ridership and turnover rate tend to increase with urban population, government expenditure, the number of bikesharing members and docking stations, whilst the number of public bikes shows significant but adverse signs in impacting bikesharing ridership and turnover rate. Data comparison shows that, to pursue an ideal bikesharing turnover rate in most Chinese cities, the bike-member (supply-demand) ratio should be better controlled within 0.2. Moreover, this study suggests that personal credit cards (allowing bikesharing members to pay \"\"personal credit\"\" rather than money if they do not return public bikes within the free use hours) and universal cards (integrating bikesharing systems into other urban transit systems through the use of a rechargeable smart card that can cover a range of payments and trips) can significantly raise bikesharing daily use and turnover rate. We recommend that bikesharing operators and transit agencies take the supply-demand thresholds and the adoption of personal credit cards and universal cards into consideration in the future bikesharing operation and development policy. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.\"\\n\"Guo P.\",\"Financial policy innovation for social change: a case study of China\\'s green credit policy\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84902653894&doi=10.1080%2f03906701.2014.894347&partnerID=40&md5=cfb5e7f975b61e80fd55b8f51a382e05\",\"Financial policy impacts on a range of social issues such as poverty alleviation, education, pollution control, etc. Making good use of financial policy and applying innovation to existing financial systems can generate positive outcomes for society. This article is to discuss the case of green credit policy in China. This policy was jointly announced in 2007 by financial and environmental regulators. According to this policy, banks were encouraged to give more loans to environmental friendly companies than to others. Such policy has made great progress, and it became a more formal document entitled \\'Green Credit Guideline\\' in 2012. This guideline included a comprehensive definition on green credit and specified several requirements at practical levels. Despite the great success, challenges of implementing such policy still remain. First, information about corporate environmental performance is insufficient; second, market incentives for green credit policy are not high enough; third, most banking staff lack knowledge and capacity to handle environmental affairs. Nevertheless, this case still sheds light on how financial policy innovation drives social changes. The key is to identify the connection between social issues and financial issues, and then to make a business case that creates pressures or incentives for financial institutions. This requires a market where social and environmental cost is appropriately priced and internalized to those who generate it. Ideally, financial policies should help shape such a market so that society can share values created by financial institutions. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 University of Rome \\'La Sapienza\\'.\"\\n\"Thiam C., Da-Costa G., Pierson J.-M.\",\"Energy aware clouds scheduling using anti-load balancing algorithm - EACAB\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84902305410&doi=10.5220%2f0004856600820089&partnerID=40&md5=247ca06814dd721a165428729798851d\",\"Cloud computing is a highly scalable and cost-effective infrastructure for running HPC, enterprise and Web applications. However rapid growth of the demand for computational power by scientific, business and web- applications has led to the creation of large-scale data centers consuming enormous amounts of electrical power. Hence, energy-efficient solutions are required to minimize their energy consumption. The objective of our approach is to reduce data center\\'s total energy consumption by controlling cloud applications\\' overall re- source usage while guarantying service level agreement. This article presents Energy aware clouds scheduling using anti-load balancing algorithm (EACAB). The proposed algorithm works by associating a credit value with each node. The credit of a node depends on its affinity to its jobs, its current workload and its com- munication behavior. Energy savings are achieved by continuous consolidation of VMs according to current utilization of resources, virtual network topologies established between VMs and thermal state of computing nodes.

This study focuses on sections of the catchment earmarked as being most promising for implementing Green Water Credits, an incentive mechanism to help farmers invest in land and soil management activities that affect all fresh water resources at source. Such management practices can also help restore SOM levels towards their natural level. Opportunities to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, for two broadly defined land use types (croplands and plantation crops, with moderate input levels), are calculated using a simple empirical model, using three scenarios for the proportion of suitable land that may be treated with these practices (low=40percent, medium=60percent, high=80percent). For the medium scenario, corresponding to implementation on ~348000ha in the basin, the eco-technologically possible SOC gains are estimated at 4\\xc2\\xb78 to 9\\xc2\\xb73\\xc3\\x97106tonnes (Mg) CO2 over the next 20years. Assuming a conservative price of US$10 per tonne CO2-equivalent on the carbon offset market, this would correspond to ~US$48-93 million over a 20-year period of sustained green water management. This would imply a projected (potential) payment of some US$7-13ha-1 to farmers annually; this sum would be in addition to incentives that are being put in place for implementing green water management practices and also in addition to the benefits that farmers would realize from the impact on production of these practices themselves. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.\"\\n\"Ren X.-M., Jiang L.-S.\",\"On pricing of corporate securities in the case of jump-diffusion\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901926058&doi=10.1007%2fs11766-014-2978-8&partnerID=40&md5=4705fc0e1683f72ba882306aab03633e\",\"Structural models of credit risk are known to present vanishing spreads at very short maturities. This shortcoming, which is due to the diffusive behavior assumed for asset values, can be circumvented by considering discontinuities of the jump type in their evolution over time. In this paper, we extend the pricing model for corporate bond and determine the default probability in jump-diffusion model to address this issue. To make the problem clearly, we first investigate the case that the firm value follows a geometric Brownian motion under similar assumptions to those in Black and Scholes (1973), Briys and de Varenne (1997), i.e, the default barrier is KD (t, T) and the recovery rate is (1 - \\xcf\\x89), where D (t, T) is the price of zero coupon default free bond and \\xcf\\x89 is a constant (0 &lt; \\xcf\\x89 \\xe2\\x89\\xa4 1). By changing the numeraire, we obtain the closed-form solution for both the price of bond and default probability. Further, we consider the case of jump-diffusion and suppose that a firm will go bankruptcy if its value Vt \\xe2\\x89\\xa4 KD (t, T) and at the same time, the bondholder will receive (1-\\xcf\\x89) Vt\\xe2\\x88\\x9aK. By introducing the Green function of PDE with absorbing boundary and converting the problem to an II-type Volterra integral equation, we get the closed-form expressions in series form for bond price and corresponding default probability.

It finds that the AGR idea does incorporate some elements farmers find useful, indeed, that they are implementing autonomously, such as use of organic soil amendments. However, the underpinning emphasis on commercialization does not allow room for them to practice site-specific SFM and subsistence mechanisms that they have developed as responses to risk. Some aspects of the AGR are themselves disadvantageous, for example repayment of credit at harvest time, the emphasis on inorganic fertilizer and land titling schemes.

Sustainable building rating systems are being increasingly adopted to assess the sustainability performance of building design and construction. Building information modelling (BIM)-based technologies are regarded as a potentially useful vehicle for helping project stakeholders to capture complete design and project information, and to make the best use of the available design data for sustainable design and sustainability rating analysis. While experience from the Leadership in Environmental Energy and Design (LEED) programme in the US has demonstrated the great potential of integrating BIM with building assessments, it is anticipated that BIM can also be effectively integrated with the Hong Kong \\'BEAM Plus\\' sustainable building rating system. This study uses a two-stage method (i.e. a Delphi study and a case study) to explore the potential use of BIM in the case of a residential building project seeking BEAM Plus sustainable building certification in Hong Kong. The Delphi study indicated that 26 out of 80 credit points could potentially be achieved with the support of the documentation produced by BIM (i.e. Autodesk Revit). Detailed procedures for conducting and testing a BIM-based BEAM Plus sustainability analysis are described. The proposed BIM-BEAM Plus assessment framework is then verified using two sampled public housing modular flat models. The complexity of the BIM-BEAM Plus application depends on the project size, the extent of the model development detail and the nature of the project. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 Elsevier B.V.\"\\n\"Chen S., Golley J.\",\"\\'Green\\' productivity growth in China\\'s industrial economy\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899563540&doi=10.1016%2fj.eneco.2014.04.002&partnerID=40&md5=e9ec5aea6f34902aff4a459f4d054f62\",\"This paper uses a Directional Distance Function (DDF) and the Malmquist-Luenberger Productivity Index to estimate the changing patterns of \\'green\\' total factor productivity (GTFP) growth of 38 Chinese industrial sectors during the period 1980-2010.

The paper further makes an attempt to explore the experience, concerns and expectations of the Indian project proponents of green projects registered with CDM Executive Board. Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs two methods: informal interviews with executives of World Bank, Designated National Authority (DNA) of India for CDM, leading international CDM consulting firms and a questionnaire survey of Indian CDM projects proponents. Findings: During first commitment period valid up to December 31, 2012, India remained active participant in the CDM, the only mechanism of Kyoto Protocol where developing countries can participate and join in mitigation of climate change, through the development of green projects and thereby earning additional revenue in terms of carbon finance by sale of carbon credits. The study finds out that in the global CDM experience, India\\'s role is striking with its second highest share both in terms of number of projects registered worldwide and in generation of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs). Originality/value: This paper provides several recommendations for strengthening the institutional frame work in India with respect to CDM as well as suggestions to policy makers for consideration while charting out future policies and programs addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation oriented towards better participation in climate change mitigation during the second commitment period of Kyoto Protocol. \\xc2\\xa9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\"\\n\"Li J., Kangas P., Terlizzi D.E.\",\"A Simple Cultivation Method for Chesapeake Bay Ulva intestinalis for Algal Seed Stock\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898933768&doi=10.1080%2f15222055.2013.869287&partnerID=40&md5=744ff14868e51f153d906b47c780df6a\",\"Ulva spp. are valuable economically as edible green algae, and they also have environmental value in biofiltration. Cultivation of Ulva spp., in fact macroalgal cultivation generally, is limited in the USA. As part of a larger effort to develop macroalgal cultivation in the Chesapeake Bay for nutrient remediation, we developed a \"\"seeding\"\" method for Chesapeake Bay isolates of U. intestinalis. Ulva intestinalis thalli were induced to produce and release free-swimming zoospores by desiccation and rehydration. The zoospores then were induced to settle on the nylon nets by dark incubation. Rhizoids from the zoospores formed on the nets, and the nets became covered with green filaments which developed tubular thalli. Nets with thalli can be incubated in indoors or deployed in natural water to generate production-scale cultivation of U. intestinalis in the Chesapeake Bay. Such cultivation can be integrated with the growing oyster aquaculture industry in the Chesapeake Bay area, U. intestinalis serving as biofilters to remove oyster wastes and increase economic benefit through water quality enhancement and nutrient credits, and as an aquaculture product in their own right.Received June 10, 2013; accepted November 15, 2013. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 American Fisheries Society 2014.\"\\n\"Fuertes G., Schiavon S.\",\"Plug load energy analysis: The role of plug loads in LEED certification and energy modeling\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84897435141&doi=10.1016%2fj.enbuild.2014.02.072&partnerID=40&md5=56e79d25db185fa5be8afb3ba4398f32\",\"Plug loads use 12% of site energy in U.S. office buildings and their relative importance is projected to increase. We studied the predicted and simulated plug load energy consumption using data submitted to the U.S. Green Building Council for LEED certification, and surveyed 92 energy modelers on their simulation techniques. 660 LEED for Commercial Interiors projects and 429 LEED for New Construction projects were analyzed. This is the first study to analyze LEED submittal data related to plug loads. The survey results indicated that 40% of modelers use between 10.8 and 16.1 W/m2 for their peak plug load estimates in offices, and 68% of modelers estimate average plug load energy use intensity to be at or less than 10.8 W/m2. LEED results show that 73% of the projects under LEED-CI that attempted the credit dedicated to plug loads earned 2 of 2 points available (90% or more of eligible equipment is ENERGY STAR rated). Under LEED-NC, the median peak and average plug load power intensity reported are 10.8 and 4.0 W/m2, respectively. LEED-NC submittal data showed that eQUEST is the most used tool for compliance.

Perceived risk, perceived benefit, justice, moral obligation, control force, and control beliefs were considered antecedents to the three components of the TPB (attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavior control, PBC). The correlation between intention and implementation of green management strategies was examined, as was the combined influence of these two factors on organizational performance. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: 333 valid questionnaires were returned from a sample of the Top 5000 corporations listed in the CCIS. Structural equation modelling was used to verify the causal relationship amongst the green management variables and performance perspectives. Findings: The results indicate that perceived risk and perceived benefit have a strong correspondence to the expressed attitudes related to green management strategies; justice and moral obligation are correlated with the subjective norm; control force and control belief are correlated with perceived behavior control (PBC). Working in conjunction, the three components of the TPB exert a strong influence on the intentions of managers and their likelihood of implementing green management strategies. These factors further affect organizational performance. Practical implications: When corporations in the service industry are compared with those in the manufacturing industry, the following five paths show significant differences: control force to PBC, control belief to PBC, attitude to strategic intention, subjective norm to strategic intention, and PBC to strategic intention. These results demonstrate that different industry clusters may lead to different path strengths as a corporation adopts green management strategies. Originality/value: This study used the TPB to explore green management adoption and was able to clarify the relationship between green management strategies and organizational performance. It is hoped that this study might provide academic as well as practical value. \\xc2\\xa9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\"\\n\"Wang Y., Wang W., Hu Z., Qiao H.\",\"An analysis of the effectiveness of China\\'s environmental financial policy\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896031359&doi=10.2495%2fMEEE20130791&partnerID=40&md5=882bf874e21127f58765f9877d0b5ee8\",\"Influencing the allocation of resources of financial market by financial policies is an important means of macroeconomic control of the government.

However, recent stimulus packages employed by advanced economies to promote economic growth integrate a strong green element. This raises questions about how the current desire for fiscal austerity interacts with existing factors that constrain or facilitate environmental policy via budgeting. By drawing on theoretical arguments that argue that macro \\'politics matters\\' in budget composition, we develop an analytical framework for explaining budgeting practices. This framework is employed to examine green budgeting in two leading but otherwise contrasting industrialised economies: the United States and the United Kingdom. Our analysis suggests that key veto players have often set the green budgeting agenda in the current age of austerity. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 Taylor & Francis.\"\\n\"Miranda A.T., Palmer E.M.\",\"Intrinsic motivation and attentional capture from gamelike features in a visual search task\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84894666477&doi=10.3758%2fs13428-013-0357-7&partnerID=40&md5=27107daf81093f0dc5ff5ac6108bf91d\",\"In psychology research studies, the goals of the experimenter and the goals of the participants often do not align. Researchers are interested in having participants who take the experimental task seriously, whereas participants are interested in earning their incentive (e.g., money or course credit) as quickly as possible. Creating experimental methods that are pleasant for participants and that reward them for effortful and accurate data generation, while not compromising the scientific integrity of the experiment, would benefit both experimenters and participants alike. Here, we explored a gamelike system of points and sound effects that rewarded participants for fast and accurate responses. We measured participant engagement at both cognitive and perceptual levels and found that the point system (which invoked subtle, anonymous social competition between participants) led to positive intrinsic motivation, while the sound effects (which were pleasant and arousing) led to attentional capture for rewarded colors. In a visual search task, points were awarded after each trial for fast and accurate responses, accompanied by short, pleasant sound effects. We adapted a paradigm from Anderson, Laurent, and Yantis (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 108(25):10367-10371, 2011b), in which participants completed a training phase during which red and green targets were probabilistically associated with reward (a point bonus multiplier). During a test phase, no points or sounds were delivered, color was irrelevant to the task, and previously rewarded targets were sometimes presented as distractors. Significantly longer response times on trials in which previously rewarded colors were present demonstrated attentional capture, and positive responses to a five-question intrinsic-motivation scale demonstrated participant engagement. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 Psychonomic Society, Inc.\"\\n\"Helion C., Gilovich T.\",\"Gift Cards and Mental Accounting: Green-lighting Hedonic Spending\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892949277&doi=10.1002%2fbdm.1813&partnerID=40&md5=b079c751ce891ddb1e464c0e40daa836\",\"In three studies, we examine the mental accounting rules that govern how gift cards are used. We predicted that their identity as gift cards would shift consumption from utilitarian to hedonic goods even in contexts where both types of goods are available and the consumer\\'s needs are unchanged. In Study 1a, participants were asked to imagine that they had both a gift card and a specified amount of cash and needed to purchase both a hedonic item and a utilitarian item. When asked which currency they would use to buy which item, respondents were significantly more likely to say they would use the gift card to buy the hedonic item. Study 1b replicated this result and found that it was tied to participants\\' beliefs how different types of money should be used. In Study 2, we found that participants who were required to spend a certain amount of their compensation in a laboratory store spent more on hedonic goods if their payment was in the form of a gift card. In Study 3, we analyzed transactions at a campus bookstore and found that shoppers tended to spend disproportionately on hedonic goods when using their gift cards than when making credit card purchases. Taken together, these studies indicate that people tend to assign the monetary value of a gift card to a hedonic mental account and spend it accordingly.

Using data spanning 1991 through 2011 from MSCI\\'s Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Indices and credit ratings from Standard and Poor\\'s representing 16,325 firm-years, the analysis finds that hospitality firms on average invest more in environmental programs than do businesses in other industries; that hospitality firms have significantly fewer environmental concerns; that strong financial performance leads to increased investments; and that going green, in turn, pays off in future periods, creating a virtuous cycle. One implication is that hospitality firms should go forward confidently in establishing their sustainability programs, as it appears that customers support the effort financially. \\xc2\\xa9 The Author(s) 2013.\"\\n\"Nelson D.\",\"Envision adoption and its impact on water infrastructure\",2014,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892836701&doi=10.5942%2fjawwa.2014.106.0009&partnerID=40&md5=5d31051a19b910d46f27328a42a8ca38\",\"The Envision\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 sustainable infrastructure rating system provides planning and design guidance, performance evaluation, and award recognition to infrastructure projects that contribute to a sustainable future.

The City was faced with the critical need to replace the aged and conditioned WTP, expand its treatment capacity, work within a tight footprint in the historic downtown area, and meet water quality objectives, all while following a tight schedule and limited budget. Garver Engineers teamed with the City of Tuscumbia Water Board to achieve these objectives. The process included conception, securing funding, design, construction, and commissioning of a fully automated advanced membrane treatment facility. The result was increased production capacity, softer water, and an aesthetically pleasing facility nestled adjacent to a public park, which blends with the architecture and character of this historic and highly visible setting. Garver conceived and evaluated the following alternatives for treatment: Alternative 1: Conventional lime softening and re-carbonation with granular media filtration, Alternative 2: Full-stream membrane filtration with either a low pressure (MF/UF) or a high pressure (NF/RO) system. Alternative 3: Full-stream low pressure (MF/UF) membranes in series with split-stream high pressure (NF/RO) membranes. The City elected to proceed with Alternative 3, because it was designed to provide credit for logremoval of pathogens, significantly reduce the level of hardness in the finished water, and work well aesthetically next to the park. As a team, Garver, the City of Tuscumbia, and BH Craig Construction delivered a new \"\"green-field\"\" water softening WTP that effectively met the city\\'s objectives for WTP replacement, increased capacity, water quality, and aesthetics, , as well as schedule and budget objectives.

Many of Caltrans\\' practices exceeded typical environmental mitigation commitments, but had not been gathered collectively into one set of sustainability practices or evaluated against industry standards. Parsons Brinckerhoff led an analysis for Caltrans District 11 to inventory sustainable practices implemented as part of the widening and realignment of State Route (SR) 76 in San Diego County. The team assessed the project against two leading national green infrastructure rating systems (FHWA and Greenroads) to help inventory the project\\'s performance, developed a preliminary project score, and gathered associated supporting documentation. The overall intent of this project was to help Caltrans raise the bar on its sustainability practices by identifying tangible steps that could be taken during both design and construction. This analysis found that the SR 76 would achieve most of the credits under the Environment and Water and Access and Equity categories, but not under Pavement Technologies. Assuming the Greenroads project requirements were met, the project would likely receive a Silver rating. Under the extended scorecard from the INVEST beta version rating system, the project would likely score a Gold rating. Enhancing pavement technology applications would help boost the rating under both systems. The analysis also confirmed that selection of a sustainability rating system would depend greatly on the needs and goals of an agency or project considering utilizing such a system. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.\"\\n\"Hedge A.\",\"The importance of ergonomics in green design\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84889763834&doi=10.1177%2f1541931213571236&partnerID=40&md5=d626f6cfe4e1b2b33e78e6485314d376\",\"In the past decade the green building movement has gathered tremendous momentum.

Changing facilities from net energy users to net energy producers is a major concern for supply chain managers who are interested in greening their business. Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is an innovative design idea to achieve energy positive buildings. In a BIPV building, photovoltaic (PV) arrays are integrated into the structure of the building in order to transform the incident solar radiation to clean energy that can be used in facility operations. This option is dependent on the economic attractiveness of the solar PVs, which, in return, depends on the policies (incentives, subsidies, feed-in tariff) in effect at the facility location, the efficiency of the PVs installed, and the amount of incident solar radiation at the facility location. We present an economic model that calculates the cost per kWh capacity of solar PVs installed and then integrate the decision of installing PVs of different sizes on the facility rooftops of a supply chain subject to the different environmental policies available. We study the implications of our model based on a sensitivity analysis for different carbon credit prices, PV generation costs, and feed-in tariff prices. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 Elsevier B.V.\"\\n\"Turner S.D.O., Chan T.C.Y.\",\"Examining the LEED rating system using inverse optimization\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84888122674&doi=10.1115%2f1.4025221&partnerID=40&md5=903f518c943df7ba4ac79bc18282e85a\",\"The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system is the most recognized green building certification program in North America. In order to be LEED certified, a building must earn a sufficient number of points, which are obtained through achieving certain credits or design elements. In LEED versions 1 and 2, each credit was worth one point. In version 3, the LEED system changed so that certain credits were worth more than one point. In this study, we develop an inverse optimization approach to examine how building designers intrinsically valued design elements in LEED version 2. Because of the change in the point system between version 2 and version 3, we aim to determine whether building designers actually valued each credit equally, and if not, whether their valuations matched the values in version 3. Due to the large dimensionality of the inverse optimization problem, we develop an approximation to improve tractability. We apply our method to 306 different LEED-certified buildings in the continental United States. We find that building designers did not value all credits equally and that other factors such as cost, building type, and size, and certification level play a role in how the credits are valued. Overall, inverse optimization may provide a new method to assess historical data and support the design of future versions of LEED.

Even though historical flooding remains an issue, chemistry, loads, and aesthetics are companion concerns. Recently, total maximum daily loads have spread across the United States. Additionally, Florida has promulgated no net load increases for runoff and constituents and now has numeric criteria for nutrients. As trends move toward low-impact development and green infrastructure, urban retrofit design practice entails hydrologic restoration, reuse, and source control. Site redesign can provide a means to manage hydrologic and constituent load, with no net increase for long-term loadings. The proposed design retrofitted an existing surface parking facility with a series of design elements. A biofiltration area reactor was lined with clay for management of the water table and denitrification. A linear infiltration reactor of cementitious permeable pavement provided infiltration and evaporation, filtration, and adsorption. Street sweeping provided source control. In addition, load credits have been established in Florida for nutrients recovered from street sweeping. Continuous simulations with climate and site data indicated that redesign could result in no load increase. Estimates demonstrated that the cost of redesign was comparable to conventional construction costs while incorporating a Florida-friendly landscape. Also, design options cost less per nutrient load treated than did conventional Florida best management practices.\"\\n\"Lohiya G.\",\"Contractors and LEED credits: Towards sustainable construction\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84887367352&doi=10.1061%2f9780784412688.106&partnerID=40&md5=98c2d570439c999a951fd30042b8b28d\",\"Sustainable development is one of the most important global concerns of contemporary times.

Quantity and quality of the SOC pool are essential to soil quality, agronomic production, and use efficiency of inputs. Furthermore, limiting global warming to a 2\\xc2\\xb0C increase in Earth\\'s mean temperature requires the identification of appropriate sinks for atmospheric CO2. Sequestration of C in soils is almost an obvious climate solution, which ironically has been overlooked by policy makers. Yet, it is a proverbial \"\"low-hanging\"\" fruit with numerous co-benefits. Most soils of the agroecosystems are depleted of their antecedent SOC pool by 25%-75%, equivalent to 10-30 Mg/ha, which is also the technical sink capacity of C sequestration. The rate of SOC sequestration in soils of the tropics and subtropics is 100-500 kg/ha/year. The potential global soil C sink capacity is 1.2-3.1 Pg C/year, 25-50 years. While mitigating climate change, an increase in SOC pool also enhances crop yield because of improvements in soil physical (i.e., aggregation, available water capacity), chemical (i.e., cation and anion exchange capacity [CEC/AEC], soil reaction, nutrient transformation), and biological properties (i.e., microbial biomass C earthworm activity). The adoption of conservation-effective measures can avoid erosion-induced emissions by minimizing decomposition of SOC transported by erosional processes. The mean residence time of SOC depends on a range of exogenous and endogenous factors. Recommended management practices (RMPs) for SOC concentration include conservation agriculture based on no-till and mulch farming, use of cover crops and green manure, application of manure and biochar, and use of perennial culture, including agroforestry. Balanced application of fertilizers is crucial. Water conservation, water harvesting and recycling, use of drip subirrigation, and growing aerobic rice are some important practices for enhancing water-use efficiency. There is a strong need for research in understanding processes of SOC sequestration, identifying and validating soil-/site-specific agronomic practices, and making policy interventions that reward farmers through payments for ecosystem services. Farming C and trading C credits are needed to create another income stream for farmers and to promote the adoption of RMPs. Cropland soils of south Asia in general and those of the Indo-Gangetic Plain in particular are severely depleted of their SOC pool. Despite high inputs of fertilizers and water, crop yields are either stagnating or declining because of the ever-declining use efficiency of inputs (i.e., fertilizers, irrigation, high-yielding varieties) and degrading soils and water resources. A low SOC concentration of cropland soils (0.1%-0.5% in the plow layer of 0-20-cm depth) is the principal cause of decline in soil quality (e.g., low aggregation and plant available water capacity). Thus, RMPs that create a positive soil C budget and enhance the SOC pool must be identified. The balanced use of fertilizers and the application of farm yard manure and other biosolids (i.e., crop residues, green manure) are essential to SOC sequestration, improving the input-use efficiency, and increasing crop yields. There is a strong and positive correlation between the SOC pool in the root zone and the grain yield of wheat, maize, soybean, and other crops. The adoption of RMPs, which enhance SOC pools and sustain high agronomic yield, necessitates payments to farmers for providing ecosystem services through the trading of C credits and so on. Farming C is an important strategy to mitigate climate change, advance food security, and improve the environment. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\"\\n\"Bautista A.C., Zhou L., Jawa V.\",\"Universal immunogenicity validation and assessment during early biotherapeutic development to support a green laboratory\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84886509048&doi=10.4155%2fbio.13.216&partnerID=40&md5=73196883ae68f00cae08dfae5cee71be\",\"Background: Immunogenicity support during nonclinical biotherapeutic development can be resource intensive if supported by conventional methodologies.

In this paper, carbon sequestration and nitrous oxide emissions from winter wheat-based cropping systems were evaluated in eastern Washington, USA, using computer simulation. System boundaries were expanded to consider fertilizer production and use of machinery in a standard life cycle assessment (LCA) study. Variations in rainfall, tillage intensity and crop rotation were considered. Potential earnings from carbon credits obtained by converting to reduced and no-till management were evaluated and compared with the corresponding changes in farm budgets. No-till increased the average soil carbon sequestration by 0.5, 0.3, 0.2Mg-Cha-1yr-1 (30-year average) in high, middle and low rainfall zones, respectively. On-farm N2O emissions contributed 60-70% of the total CO2-equivalent emissions (CO2eha-1yr-1) in high and middle rainfall scenarios and 30-40% in low rainfall scenarios. Production of fertilizers contributed 13\\xc2\\xb13% of total emissions. Emissions from fuel consumption varied across sites due to differences in machinery use with different topography, tillage, soils and number of fallow years. Reduced tillage systems are more profitable in the moderate and high rainfall zones with 2011 crop price and input cost assumptions but they are less profitable in the drier rainfall zone. Even a more inclusive accounting with LCA that includes credits for reductions in N2O emissions, fuel usage and fertilizer production was insufficient to compensate for the lower returns. With the net market price assumption of 2.48$CO2e-1ha-1yr-1, the CO2e credits for reducing tillage ranged from 0.27 to 1.63$CO2e-1ha-1yr-1 across the region. \\xc2\\xa9 2013.\"\\n\"Fujita H., Koide N., Sonehara N., Okuhara K., Tsubaki H., Prayitno J.\",\"Environmental credit social system for good practices\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84885968529&doi=10.1109%2fTIME-E.2013.6611953&partnerID=40&md5=38543e19af9a187bcdee459bf7226a4c\",\"Mobile applications in Black Berry and Android were developed to simulate participants\\' waste recycling good practices shown as in Green House Gas emission kg CO2e reduction, and those applications were further incorporated within an environmental credit social system for good practices, based upon an environmental database.

The GHG emission reduction in kg CO2e is calculated and corresponding GHG credit will be added onto an environment household account of a recycling contributor. The GHG credits can also be obtained by member\\'s purchases of goods, foods and services from cooperative shops, restaurants, and public facilities that participate in the environmental credit social system, as well as make own contributions to reduce GHG emission in their operations.

This environmental credit social system drives the whole society to reduce GHG emission, as well as develops business and the economy in the society. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 IEEE.\"\\n\"Copeland C.\",\"Green infrastructure and issues in managing urban stormwater\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84953247171&partnerID=40&md5=8ef9286712bb1eae436158e9ca461c64\",\"For decades, stormwater, or runoff, was considered largely a problem of excess rainwater or snowmelt impacting communities. Prevailing engineering practices were to move stormwater away from cities as rapidly as possible to avoid potential damages from flooding. More recently, these practices have evolved and come to recognize stormwater as a resource that, managed properly within communities, has multiple benefits. Stormwater problems occur because rainwater that once soaked into the ground now runs off hard surfaces like rooftops, parking lots, and streets in excessive amounts. This runoff flows into storm drains and ultimately into lakes and streams, carrying pollutants that are harmful to aquatic life and public health. Traditional approaches to managing urban stormwater have utilized so-called \"\"gray infrastructure,\"\" including pipes, gutters, ditches, and storm sewers. More recently, interest has grown in \"\"green infrastructure\"\" technologies and practices in place of or in combination with gray infrastructure. Green infrastructure systems use or mimic natural processes to infiltrate, evapotranspire, or reuse stormwater runoff on the site where it is generated. These practices keep rainwater out of the sewer system, thus preventing sewer overflows and also reducing the amount of untreated runoff discharged to surface waters. Cities\\' adoption of green technologies and practices has increased, motivated by several factors. One motivation is environmental and resource benefits. Advocates, including environmental groups, landscape architects, and urban planners, have drawn attention to these practices. But an equally important motivation, perhaps larger than environmental benefits, is costsaving opportunities for cities that face enormous costs of stormwater infrastructure projects to meet requirements of the Clean Water Act. Other potential benefits include reduced flood damages, improved air quality, and improved urban aesthetics. At the same time, barriers to implementing green infrastructure include lack of information on performance and costeffectiveness and uncertainty whether the practices will contribute to achieving water quality improvements. Another key barrier is lack of funding. At the federal level, there is no single source of dedicated federal funding to design and implement green infrastructure solutions. Without assistance, communities take several approaches to financing wastewater and stormwater projects; the most frequently used tool is issuance of municipal bonds. As a dedicated funding source for projects, the number of local stormwater utilities that charge fees has grown in recent years. Many municipalities try to encourage homeowners and developers to incorporate green infrastructure practices by offering incentives. The most common types of local incentive mechanisms are stormwater fee discounts or credits, development incentives, rebates or financing for installation of specific practices, and award and recognition programs. The Environmental Protection Agency\\'s (EPA\\'s) interest in and support for green infrastructure has grown since the 1990s. The agency has provided technical assistance and information and developed policies to facilitate and encourage green infrastructure solutions and incorporation in Clean Water Act permits. Pressed by municipalities about the challenges and costs that they face in addressing needs for wastewater and stormwater projects, in 2012 EPA issued an integrated permitting and planning framework for water infrastructure projects. The intention of the framework document is to provide communities with flexibility to prioritize needed water infrastructure investments. One component of the framework is identifying green infrastructure opportunities. EPA also is working with communities to refine how the agency determines when an infrastructure project is affordable for individual communities. Green infrastructure also is expected to be a key element of an upcoming EPA rulemaking to revise stormwater permit regulations. Congress has shown some interest in these issues. In the 112th Congress, bills were introduced to support research and implementation of green infrastructure and also to codify an integrated approach to permitting and planning of water infrastructure projects. None of these bills has been reintroduced in the 113th Congress. Also in the 112th Congress, a House subcommittee held hearings on EPA\\'s efforts to provide flexibility to communities in prioritizing water infrastructure. Overall, many in Congress remain concerned about how municipalities will pay for needed investments in water infrastructure projects generally-not limited to green infrastructure-and what role the federal government can and should play in those efforts. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

A direct effect of more efficient processes is that the emission of green house gases, particularly carbon dioxide decreases. In households nowadays \"\"high efficiency furnaces\"\" are available with efficiencies in the range of 94-97%. This paper describes the outcome of a feasibility study on applying the high efficiency furnace concept to steam cracking furnaces. The high efficiency is achieved by enhanced heat recovery from the flue gases before they are released to the atmosphere at ca. 65 \\xc2\\xb0C. Technip studied the application of this concept for cracking furnaces based on gas as well as liquid feedstocks. Natural gas was used as basis for the energy price. Since energy prices have a strong impact on project economics, the evaluations were done for an EU average natural gas price and a US natural gas price. Two alternative heat sinks have been considered: preheating of combustion air and preheating of cold hydrocarbon feed. Both are viable for liquid cracking furnaces. In the case of gas cracking furnaces feed preheating results in a pinch and this makes it not viable. Capital costs are based on Technip\\'s cost database and quotations from air preheater vendors. Special attention has been paid to the material selection of the affected convection section banks. This study shows that high efficiency ethylene cracking furnaces are economically viable. For Europe the study indicates an attractive payback period. In the US the payback period is longer due to the lower energy prices. If energy prices increase in the future, the concept\\'s economic viability will become better. Inclusion of CO2 credits will make the payback period more attractive.\"\\n\"French E.\",\"\"\"Greenbacks\"\" versus green credits: Has the Carbon Farming Initiative got the balance right?\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883777682&partnerID=40&md5=cc761c5d3a7c9a643aafeda0b0e45c32\",\"The Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI) is an Australian government carbon offset scheme allowing agricultural producers to generate carbon credits from emissions mitigation and sequestration activities on Australian farms.

Though sediment and water yield from these degraded watersheds could have been minimized by implementing ecologically sustainable management practices (EMPs), such as grass land, forest land and detention pond, poor economic conditions of the people stands in the way of field implementation. On the other hand, major industries, which can be held responsible for emission of greenhouse gases, can be asked to finance greenery development in these hilly watersheds through implementation of selected EMPs to earn carbon credit for them. To convert this concept into reality, the EMP combination must be selected in such a way that it restricts sediment and water yield from the watershed within the permissible limit and maximizes its carbon sequestration capacity at minimum possible cost. Such optimal planning is a prerequisite for preparing an acceptable logical agreement between Government and private companies. Keeping this in mind, an optimization model was developed and applied to a micro watershed of Guwahati to explore its applicability in actual field. The model developed in this study provides most logical carbon credit negotiation, subject to the availability of reliable value of CO2 sequestration for different EMPs. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.\"\\n\"Cho C.H., Patten D.M.\",\"Green accounting: Reflections from a CSR and environmental disclosure perspective\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84882285403&doi=10.1016%2fj.cpa.2013.04.003&partnerID=40&md5=ca57caca60f8877ac5fcbb2e65805882\",\"In this commentary, we reflect on Thornton\\'s (2013) extension to his original CA Magazine article on environmental accounting (Thornton, 1993) as well as the original contribution.

With differing perceptions of how green building is best achieved, here we focus on how geographical context and reuse of existing buildings are rewarded. The conceptual framework for our analysis draws upon a light green/deep green dichotomy in sustainability and architectural design. While a light green perspective achieves reduced energy consumption and pollution through technology and green gadgetry, a deep green approach focuses on local geographic conditions to work with natural climate systems through design informed by vernacular architecture, as well as the benefits of adaptive reuse. This study uses a descriptive case study analysis of LEED credit points earned in six certified buildings in Denver and Boulder, Colorado. Our analysis confirms that LEED rewards more light green approaches. There is limited motivation in pursuing sustainability through deep green methods, as recognition of them in LEED is quite minimal. We conclude that the balance against rewarding deep green design limits more transformative paradigm-shifting advances in sustainability. Recommendations for improvements to LEED are given, as well as a discussion on emerging local governance in regulating green building. This paper contributes to the emerging body of literature focusing on green building as a mechanism of urban sustainability, and draws up the geographic perspectives of scale, place, and the political and economic linkages between humans and the environment in cities. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 The Authors.

As a result, constructors need and want a better understanding of their roles and responsibilities in Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) projects, while exploring ways to provide a \"\"value- added\"\" service to the projects. Past research has identified \"\"Innovation in Design (ID)\"\" credits as a potential \"\"value-added opportunity\"\" for constructors to become preferred members of LEED project teams. Similar opportunities may also exist on Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) project teams. This paper seeks to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology encompassed an overview of \"\"Innovation Credits (IC)\"\" in LEED-NC, BREEAM green building guidelines and an analysis of the ID category in LEED-NC from a constructor\\'s viewpoint in general, and electrical contractors in particular. Findings - The findings of this research have identified ID credits as a potential \"\"value-added opportunity\"\" for constructors to become preferred members of the LEED project teams. In contrast to LEED, this research has identified that similar opportunities for constructors do not exist for ICs under BREEAM as past or current ICs are not available in the public domain unless accessed by a BREEAM Assessor or Approved Person. This lack of access to information could have a negative impact and stifle future innovations and is an area worthy of further research. Originality/value - This research provides an understanding of the constructor\\'s role in the ID category and contributes to the broader literature related to the role of the construction industry in the green building movement. It is envisioned that the research output will serve as easy to use reference resources for the electrical contracting industry for proposing and achieving ID credits on LEED projects. It is also envisaged that this research will lead to recognition of the need for BREEAM ICs to be accessed within the public domain. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

A direct effect of more efficient processes is that the emission of green house gases, particularly carbon dioxide decreases. In households nowadays \"\"high efficiency furnaces\"\" are available with efficiencies in the range of 94-97%. This paper describes the outcome of a feasibility study on applying the high efficiency furnace concept to steam cracking furnaces. The high efficiency is achieved by enhanced heat recovery from the flue gases before they are released to the atmosphere at ca. 65\\xc2\\xb0C. Technip studied the application of this concept for cracking furnaces based on gas as well as liquid feedstocks. Natural gas was used as basis for the energy price. Since energy prices have a strong impact on project economics, the evaluations were done for an EU average natural gas price and a US natural gas price. Two alternative heat sinks have been considered: preheating of combustion air and preheating of cold hydrocarbon feed. Both are viable for liquid cracking furnaces. In the case of gas cracking furnaces feed preheating results in a pinch and this makes it not viable. Capital costs are based on Technip\\'s cost database and quotations from air preheater vendors. Special attention has been paid to the material selection of the affected convection section banks. This study shows that high efficiency ethylene cracking furnaces are economically viable. For Europe the study indicates an attractive payback period. In the US the payback period is longer due to the lower energy prices. If energy prices increase in the future, the concept\\'s economic viability will become better. Inclusion of CO2 credits will make the payback period more attractive.\"\\n\"Sonnenschein L.\",\"Community participation mechanism: A study of youth voices in conservation\\'s GreenLeaf marketplace\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84935144047&doi=10.1007%2f978-94-007-5995-4_8&partnerID=40&md5=659a63ff1be56b0c9159f3f2d7fe2794\",\"This chapter focuses on international mechanisms for addressing climate change, focusing on linkages and multistakeholder communications, adaptations, and adoptions for greater sustainability. Since the Kyoto Protocol was organized, the idea of creating a carbon credit marketplace has been widely discussed. The United Nations has created a carbon credit certification process, and, at this point, there are a number of recognized evaluators for these credits. Unfortunately, the credit marketplace has substantially changed, and the availability of using this type of financial transaction for encouragement of developing countries to utilize their present initiatives to receive funds for their transition towards sustainability for which the developed countries and corporations would purchase these credits has failed. Failure in the sense that when funds are received by these developing countries, these funds are often diverted and actions towards a lower-carbon lifestyle have not been achieved. Conversely, a number of agencies have funded more localized projects that engage in developing sustainable actions in communities through improved mechanisms, such as sustainable forestry and agriculture and sustainable lifestyles including improved cooking stoves, water recycling, and waste recycling through biogas generation. Many of these projects at the point of achievement for their sustainability lack continued funding necessary to allow for sustainable development. The Youth Voices in Conservation Program has researched youth action towards conservation and sustainability from the classroom, the field site, and within nongovernmental and governmental organizational situations for the past few years. This research found that by developing a residual funding based upon carbon credit offsets created by these localized actions, there is a possibility of conditional cash transfer based upon these good actions. During the latter half of July 2011, intensive fieldwork in conjunction with UNDP-GEF Small Grants Projects and Center for Environment Education (CEE) occurred in India. Ten projects were evaluated for the establishment of an intranet/Internet evaluation mechanism that would allow for the development of the GreenLeaf Marketplace. Projects were also evaluated for their approach to reducing the carbon impact which correlated to the community financially, educationally, and environmentally. Detailed description of how this methodology works for developing financial environmental and financial communities will be discussed. It is hoped through a global mechanism that other localities throughout the world will be able to sign up through this computer-based system. The results of this research indicate that the Youth Voices in Conservation\\'s GreenLeaf Program may be able to address localized sustainability issues as well as methodology for decreasing carbon footprints and increasing financial sustainabilities within each community, and consequently, the environmental effects from the wide-scale adoption of these plans may be expected. It is anticipated that these credit mechanisms may be used with local bank issuance for green purposes with conditional cash transfer as part of the residual credit program. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Using Carson\\'s personal correspondence, this paper reveals that the primary source for Carson\\'s book was the extensive evidence and contacts compiled by two biodynamic farmers, Marjorie Spock and Mary T. Richards, of Long Island, New York. Their evidence was compiled for a suite of legal actions (1957-1960) against the U.S. Government and that contested the aerial spraying of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). During Rudolf Steiner\\'s lifetime, Spock and Richards both studied at Steiner\\'s Goetheanum, the headquarters of Anthroposophy, located in Dornach, Switzerland. Spock and Richards were prominent U.S. anthroposophists, and established a biodynamic farm under the tutelage of the leading biodynamics exponent of the time, Dr. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer. When their property was under threat from a government program of DDT spraying, they brought their case, eventually lost it, in the process spent US$100,000, and compiled the evidence that they then shared with Carson, who used it, and their extensive contacts and the trial transcripts, as the primary input for Silent Spring. Carson attributed to Spock, Richards, and Pfeiffer, no credit whatsoever in her book. As a consequence, the organics movement has not received the recognition, that is its due, as the primary impulse for Silent Spring, and it is, itself, unaware of this provenance. \\xc2\\xa9 The Author(s) 2013.\"\\n\"Chen P.-C., Jeng T., Deng Y.-S., Chien S.-F.\",\"GreenSense: Developing persuasive service technology by integrating mobile devices and social interaction for sustainable and healthy behavior\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84880736702&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-39191-0_39&partnerID=40&md5=d72d9750c421b4ba0cad36a3aa50389c\",\"Energy and carbon dioxide emissions are becoming the major issue for creating a sustainable living environment.

Moreover, the unchanged human behavior and habits are the major obstacles toward the sustainable living. In this paper, we proposed a mobile persuasive service to promote \"\"green\"\" sense that encourages sustainable transportation by revealing both sustainable and health information to users. The service design includes: 1) A mobile App for users to monitor their own transportation behaviors; 2) A visualization interface for users better realizing their own performance and states; 3) A virtual \"\"Green Credit\"\" rewards concept to create social interactions and encourage behavior change.

In each building on-site physical measurements at a sample of workstations (N= 974) were taken, including: thermal conditions, air quality, acoustics, lighting, workstation size, ceiling height, window access and shading, and surface finishes.

Better outcomes included: environmental satisfaction, satisfaction with thermal conditions, satisfaction with the view to the outside, aesthetic appearance, less disturbance from heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) noise, workplace image, night-time sleep quality, mood, physical symptoms, and reduced number of airborne particulates. A variety of physical features led to improved occupant outcomes across all buildings, including: conditions associated with speech privacy, lower background noise levels, higher light levels, greater access to windows, conditions associated with thermal comfort, and fewer airborne particulates.

These goals are often complementary, but can also create tensions in the design and application of rating systems. Recent patterns and trends are considered for projects certified using LEED-NC and LEED-EBOM (new construction and existing buildings, respectively) rating systems. New data are presented on (1) patterns and trends in on-going market transformation (credit achievement, levels of certification and types, geographic distribution of project, etc.) and (2) the design and revision of the LEED rating system based on broad patterns of engagement and the achievement of individual credits. The data indicate strong regional and temporal variation in green building activity. The flexibility of LEED has allowed a diversity of credit achievement patterns.

In a regional economic context, numerous local municipalities in Japan are attempting to reduce CO2 emissions by making use of regional environmental resources such as wood (forest), wind and sunlight (solar). Some municipalities export as well as intraregional usage as an alternative of oil resources. These municipalities usually estimate how much CO2 can be reduced by their environmental activities. However, the economic impacts of such efforts are ambiguous. Representative policies for correcting regional income disparities so far include income transfers, plant location as related to outside areas and public investment. These policies, however, depend on national policies. In this study, we focused on regional environmental resources, particularly wood biomass, and examined economic effects of the utilization of such regional environmental resources by applying an extended regional I-O analysis. To do so, we first constructed two types of I-O tables at the prefecture level and city/town level by making use of survey methods to obtain import/export data. Next, we reconstructed regional I-O tables by focusing on wood biomass and CO2 credit service sectors to evaluate the economic effects of wood biomass and exporting credit. We defined economic effects of introducing renewable energy as three kinds: intraregional circulation effects as energy alternatives, export effects and supply cost effects. Transduction to biomass energy from oil induces changes in the structure of the input-output linkage. After conducting several simulations including changes in I-O structure, we found that the use of wood biomass contributes to an increase in regional per capita income if trading carbon offset credit is institutionalized. This effect is more significant at the city/town level than prefecture level.\"\\n\"Newman A.\",\"The green corporate citizen?

This could be leveraged to improve both investment assessment and corporate environmental reporting. It further proposes a trial incentive mechanism - the Green Chartered Corporation - to encourage Australian companies to participate in CSR. Companies could enter into an agreement with government agencies to perform certain sustainability activities (such as supply chain enhancement, energy efficiency or carbon reduction projects or compliance with enhanced pollution standards) in exchange for a tax credit. The agreement would oblige the company to insert a \\'replaceable rule\\' into its constitution to take measures which comply or exceed compliance with the agreement. \\xc2\\xa9 Australian Centre for Climate and Environmental Law 2013.\"\\n\"Chen Y., Wang L.\",\"Renewable Portfolio Standards in the Presence of Green Consumers and Emissions Trading\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878589052&doi=10.1007%2fs11067-012-9176-0&partnerID=40&md5=10f4f5b944012dd9dc230e940c9d461e\",\"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trading, green pricing programs and renewable portfolio standards (RPS) are three concurrent policies implemented in the United States to reduce reliance on fossil fuel and GHG emissions. Despite their differences in policy targets, they are closely related and integrated with competitive electric markets. This paper examines the interactions among these three policies by considering two aspects of the RPS policy design: double-counting and bundling. Whereas the former grants utilities using the same MWh of renewable energy to meet RPS and to sell as green power, the latter allows them to bundle the renewable energy credits/certificates (RECs) with non-renewable electricity and sell as green power. This paper studies the policy designs by formulating each policy combination as a market model, which treats electricity as a differentiated product. We derive the conditions under which the REC price serves as the upper bound of the green premium or vice versa. The theoretical analysis shows that the bundling could be redundant in the presence of double counting. The policies that allow for double-counting appear to be a better choice, since they result in a higher social surplus. Most surplus gains are due to consumers surplus from green power sales. The framework we develop in this paper is capable of incorporating other detailed policy designs in the analysis such as strategic reserve and offset. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.\"\\n\"Bi T.\",\"Research of development policy for renewable energy industry\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876950192&doi=10.4028%2fwww.scientific.net%2fAMM.291-294.1185&partnerID=40&md5=a369fa1076754d989375385e005ffa2e\",\"The issues of energy and environment were two outstanding problems to control our economical and social sustainable development.

As for China, there are still many difficulties and problems realizing the sustainable development of renewable energy industry, and we need to take the positive study and learn from foreign advanced experience. In biological energy, water power, wind power and solar energy and some like, we need to establish and perfect the relevant measures, and further make the development of renewable energy industry clear in the position of the national strategies. And improving the more positive policy to encourage to support renewable energy industry development, and earnestly carrying out tax, credit, investment, pricing and subsidies policies, supporting renewable energy industry international standards, promoting new energy resources, saving and replacing the fossil energy are the strategic choices to guarantee energy security, optimize the energy structure, and promote national economic and social sustainable development, and protect the ecological environment responding to climate change, to adjust the industrial structure. \\xc2\\xa9 (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.\"\\n\"Merry K., Siry J., Bettinger P., Bowker J.M.\",\"Efficient assessments of urban tree planting potential within or near the southern Piedmont region of the United States\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875787615&doi=10.1016%2fj.compenvurbsys.2013.01.005&partnerID=40&md5=3f5d770a1fc8ea173c1abc3417d9f202\",\"Urban forest carbon offset projects have the potential to draw substantial amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, increase green space, and possibly generate revenue for landowners in cities capable of trading credits associated with these projects. The area of 15 cities in or near the Piedmont region of the southern United States on which trees could be potentially planted was explored in this analysis. The objectives were to assess a straightforward time-efficient method of classifying land and to determine the extent of the open and plantable areas in these cities. Overall accuracy of the classification process ranged from about 69% to 95%, and on average was 80.1%. The average producer\\'s accuracy for all land classes in all 15 cities was 84.2%, while the average producer\\'s accuracy for the open land class was 78.7%. The average user\\'s accuracy for all land classes and the open class was about 80%. We estimate the amount of open, tree-plantable area in these 15 cities to be a little over 43,300hectares (ha), comparable to the size of Washington, DC, or about 36 new Harvard Forests (Massachusetts). Extrapolating these results to the entire Piedmont region, the total plantable area in cities would amount to about 438,500ha, and potentially allow 108 million tons of CO2 to be sequestered, with a value of about 1.084 billion U.S. dollars. Given the small sample size and the variation within the results, the most conservative 95% confidence interval around these estimates suggests that the plantable area today is between about 274,300ha and 645,100ha. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\"\\n\"Kalochristianakis M., Grammatikakis K., Saldaris M., Demesoukas I., Tzanodaskalakis G.\",\"The concept and design of an open integrated print charging system\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84885175115&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2012.2223514&partnerID=40&md5=2defa7fda78acf3f0441d37e7b37059b\",\"Print management solutions are necessary for organizations that need to monitor, report and charge printing or photocopying usage, especially in large domains where business goals require streamlined procedures. High-end print management systems offer integrated credit reception and efficient, parametrized accounting for the use of resources. The usage of printers and photocopy machines is controlled and monitored, and, through the latter, waste elimination is achieved. Print management inherently conforms with the rationale and mentality of green and eco-friendly technologies that also relate with the ethos of the open source movement in IT. One would expect that open source print management solutions would thrive; however, the vast majority of integrated management systems are commercial. There is only a small number of valuable open source print accounting solutions, but there are none that integrate accounting with a form of credit reception. This paper presents the design of an open system that integrates the provision of automated credit reception with accounting services in order to produce an open solution that fully automates the business process of print charging. The objective is to design the necessary automations for credit reception so that it can be realized without any human intervention, to plan the integration with a suitable open print accounting system and to specify any complementary utilities and tools necessary for production installations. \\xc2\\xa9 2007-2012 IEEE.\"\\n\"Van Der Gaast W., Oikonomou V., Flamos A.\",\"Domestic Offsets in Practice: Modalities and implications\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872438535&doi=10.1080%2f15567240903330392&partnerID=40&md5=743b7d0c117f623771c1986746b17ed2\",\"Greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction projects implemented at European Union Member States in non-Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) sectors are referred to as domestic offset (DO) projects.

Construction industry with the high contributes with gross domestic product, has undeniable impacts on the economy. Although Green buildings provide a wide range of benefits for the society, green building development suffers from different kinds of market barriers in developing countries including Malaysia. In order to meet green building development in Malaysia, this study aims to investigate the level of developing green building in the current situation, to find important key players and to identify, and to eliminate the important obstacles to green building development. In this research, the respondents were randomly selected from the professionals of Malaysian construction industry across the country and the method applied for collecting data is questionnaire survey. All the questionnaires were sent out to the respondents manually or through e-mail. A total of 673 sets of questionnaire were sent out and 167 (24.81%) questionnaires were received. The quantitative method was used for analysing data through SPSS version 19. Based on the results, the level of developing green building in Malaysia is not satisfied and government has a key role in the development of green buildings in Malaysia. The main barriers can be listed as: lack of credit resources to cover up front cost, risk of investment, lack of demand as well as higher final price.\"\\n\"Tamura K., Fukuda K.\",\"Financing the low carbon energy sector in the context of future climate regime negotiations\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123141807&doi=10.4324%2f9780203141564-19&partnerID=40&md5=5fcd5203b0042e597ff6c027b3767578\",\"This chapter assesses international discussions on how investment and financial flows can be enhanced to accelerate the transition to low carbon, climate resilient economies (LCEs) under a future climate regime, with an emphasis on clean energy finance in developing Asia, and provides policy recommendations for moving forward. Energy demand in developing Asia is accelerating rapidly because of growing populations and rapid economic and social transformations characterized by industrialization and urbanization. For example, driven by brisk economic growth, China and India alone are expected to account for 50 percent of growth in global primary energy demand between 2010 and 2035 (IEA 2011). Consequently, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from this region are expected to rise quickly. Thus, a transformation of the energy sector into one that is low carbon will require fundamental changes in investment portfolios. In order to avoid carbon lock-in, strategic energy transformation measures should be carried out quickly and aggressively.1 However, there will be substantial challenges. Indeed, the Cancun Agreements, which were adopted at the 16th Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), recognize the need for mobilizing as much as $100 billion per year by 2020 through the establishment of a Green Climate Fund (GCF). However, critical questions such as how to mobilize this amount of money and how the GCF should be governed, remain unsolved. Thus, there is a critical need to explore international policy options that channel investment and financial flows into low carbon, climate resilient energy development in Asia. The chapter begins by briefly summarizing the current status of international efforts to finance climate smart development, and identifying the challenges that such efforts are facing. In the context of international negotiations for the future climate regime, we consider two key issues: How should funds be raised through public financial mechanisms? and What should be funded and how? With regard to the latter, several options are considered along the main stages of the technology innovation chain: research and development (R&D), demonstration, and deployment. Although we do not explicitly address the issue of governance, our two fundamental questions have broad implications for governance. The chapter concludes by suggesting the way forward to strengthen financial mechanisms under a future climate regime. The policy recommendations include the following: \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 New and additional financial resources should be raised through a combination of a levy on, and the auctioning of, carbon credits; a levy on international air travel and shipping; and mobilization of financial resources through market mechanisms under a future climate regime. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 selection and editorial material, Ancha Srinivasan, Frank Hiroshi Ling and Hideyuki Mori; individual chapters, the contributors.\"\\n\"Gowland D.H.\",\"Controlling the money supply\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079313400&doi=10.4324%2f9780203740705&partnerID=40&md5=5f0f6a42450e41d38952fd9ceb7b2433\",\"Intended as a successor to Monetary Policy and Credit Control (Croom Helm, 1978; Routledge Revivals, 2013), this book, first published in 1982 with a revised edition in 1984, traces the changes in approach to monetary control in the U.K. throughout the 1970s, and the consequences for policy and the British economy.

The evaluation was done through a review of existing biomass conversion technologies that could be replaced by gasifiers and the availability of potential feedstock fuels, an economic analysis of potential gasification projects under different conditions with the use of RETScreen Clean Energy Project Analysis Software, and highlighting possible solutions to the challenges which the technology faces. The findings show a continued heavy reliance on wood fuels for thermal energy together with a high use of inefficient conversion technologies in industries. Furthermore, significant quantities of agricultural residues remain un-utilized which could substitute about 40\\xc2\\xa0% of wood fuel use in industries. The economic analysis shows that the adoption of gasification technologies is economically viable, due to the high potential for revenues from fuel savings and the associated Green House Gas (GHG) emissions reductions when agricultural residues substitute or supplement the use of wood fuel. Some of the identified limitations of biomass gasification technology include liquidity constraints of the potential users, the lack of local knowledge in the design, manufacture and operation of gasifiers as well as the hazard and safety issues of gasifiers. It can be said that biomass gasification can play a major role in energy efficiency and a shift from the wood fuel dependency in small-scale industries, which is important for the environment and beneficial to the users. However, there is need for incentives such as tax holidays, tax waivers on equipment as well as reduced debt payment rates to enable industries afford the required capital investments. Institutional mechanisms for easy access to carbon credit markets are also necessary as GHG emissions reduction revenues contribute a significant portion of the annual revenues. Also investment in research and development of local skills in the design, manufacture and operation of gasifiers is vital to further reduce the capital investments and ensure proper management of the gasification-related hazard and safety issues. \\xc2\\xa9 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\"\\n\"Schroll P.\",\"Early pioneers of organic photochemistry\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84979164996&doi=10.1515%2f9783110269246.3&partnerID=40&md5=e766e759fc2d3d0520c57667d0b7b1da\",\"\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen oil will have been all burned in our prodigal industries, it may become necessary, even on social grounds, to come to exploit solar energy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d [1] This foresightful statement fits perfectly into modern debates at the beginning of the twenty-first century about the necessity of using renewable energies, but is in fact more than one hundred years old, written by Giacomo Ciamician, an early pioneer of organic photochemistry. He was a visionary chemist who was invaluable in developing photochemistry, an upcoming science at the beginning of the twentieth century. Apart from his credits to discover several new photochemical reactions, he was interested in using these reactions on an industrial scale. Nevertheless, chemical transformations under the influence of light were known long before. In 1790, Joseph Priestley (1733-1800) exposed partially filled vials of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspirit of nitre\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (nitric acid) to sunlight and observed a reddish color, which was attributed to the formation of nitrogen dioxide (Figure 2.1). This first photochemical reaction in the gas phase marks the beginning of photochemistry. [2] Moreover, Priestley is given credit for discovering basic principles of photosynthesis, the most important photochemical process for living organisms on earth. He \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfully ascertained the influence of light in the production of dephlogisticated air (oxygen) in water by means of a green substance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which was identified as tiny plants. [2, 3] After Nicholas Theodore de Saussure (1767-1845) had shown in 1804 that the influence of light causes plants to consume water and carbon dioxide and to generate oxygen, a fundamental understanding of the process of photosynthesis in green plants had been discovered.

It operates under a renewable charter, the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (P.L. 79-173), as amended. Potential issues for Congress in examining the Ex-Im Bank\\'s authority include the following: \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The economic rationale for the Bank, including the role of the federal government in export promotion and finance; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Specific Bank policies, such as those relating to content, shipping, economic and environmental impact analysis, and tied aid, including how these policies balance U.S. export and other policy interests; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Statutory requirements directing the Ex-Im Bank to support certain types of exports, such as exports of small businesses and \"\"green\"\" technology, including the tension that such requirements can create between desiring to support specific economic sectors and allowing the Ex-Im Bank flexibility to fulfill its mission to support U.S. exports and jobs; and \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 International developments that may affect the Bank\\'s work, such as the growing role of emerging economies\\' ECAs and the sufficiency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits to \"\"level the playing field\"\" for U.S. exporters. Potential options for Congress include, but are not limited to, the following areas: \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Structure of the Bank. Congress could maintain the Ex-Im Bank as an independent agency, reorganize or privatize the functions of the Bank, or terminate the Bank. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Length of reauthorization. Congress could extend the Bank\\'s authority for a few years at a time (as in previous reauthorizations), for a longer period of time, or permanently reauthorize the Bank. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Bank\\'s policies. Congress could maintain the status quo, or revise the Bank\\'s policies, such as those related to the requirements and limitations on the Ex-Im Bank\\'s credit and insurance activities. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 International ECA context. Congress could seek to enhance international regulation of official export credit activity through the OECD or other mechanisms, or enhance the Ex-Im Bank\\'s understanding of international export credit activity and trends. Most recently, Congress passed H.R. 2072 to extend the Bank\\'s authority through FY2014; previously, the Bank\\'s authority was extended to May 31, 2012.

The services (the Army, Navy, and Air Force) have spent approximately $48 million to purchase alternative fuels, and the Navy has proposed a $170 million investment in biofuel production capacity. The services have also spent funds on testing, certification and demonstrations of alternative fuels. By comparison, DOD purchases of petroleum fuels totaled approximately $17.3 billion in FY2011. DOD officials have said that any alternative fuels for DOD operational use must \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 be \"\"drop-in;\"\" that is, requiring no modification to existing engines, and \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 be cost-competitive with conventional petroleum fuels. Other desirable characteristics include \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 production from a non-food crop feedstock; and \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions less than or equal to conventional petroleum fuels. Each military service has different alternative fuel goals. The Army has the broad aim of increasing the use of renewable energy, but has not adopted any specific alternative fuel goals. The Air Force goals are to test and certify all aircraft and systems on a 50:50 alternative fuel blend by 2012, and to be prepared to acquire 50% of the Air Force\\'s domestic aviation fuel as an alternative fuel blend by 2016. The Navy\\'s goals are to deploy a \"\"Great Green Fleet\"\" strike group of ships and aircraft running entirely on alternative fuel blends by 2016 and to meet 50% of the Navy\\'s total energy consumption from alternative sources by 2020. To meet this goal for its ships, the Navy would need to replace approximately 8 million barrels of petroleum used in its ships with unblended alternative fuels by 2020. The Navy has also entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture to promote the development of a domestic advanced biofuel industry through the construction of domestic biofuel plants and refineries. Under the Defense Production Act, the Navy and the Department of Energy plan to fund this initiative with $340 million in federal funds for capital investment and production, with at least equal cost-sharing from industry. The Department of Agriculture intends to provide an additional $171 million through the Commodity Credit Corporation to support biofuel feedstocks. Legislative debate in 2012 related to DOD\\'s alternative fuels efforts has focused on two areas: (1) proposals in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 (H.R. 4310, S. 3254) to maintain or limit DOD\\'s ability to purchase alternative fuels and invest in biofuel production capability, and (2) appropriations related to the joint Navy, Department of Energy, and Department of Agriculture biofuel production initiative. Additional areas for potential congressional oversight include the costs and benefits to DOD of alternative fuels, as well as the coordination of alternative fuel initiatives within the services and between DOD and other federal agencies. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The survey inquired about earned LEED credits and best practices in LEED certification process regarding past experiences. The same survey was administered to seven Turkish contractors, who also built LEED certified green buildings in Turkey. The similarities and differences between US and Turkish constructors\\' perspectives were studied. Both groups stated that the LEED process was slightly difficult or was just straightforward. US contractors needed a lot of additional time for the LEED documentation; Turkish contractors required no extra time. LEED certification system incurred a little additional cost for US contractors; however Turkish contractors mentioned about up to 10% additional project costs. The achieved LEED credits from materials and resources, and indoor environmental quality by the two groups of contractors were highly correlated.

Promoting water efficiency in buildings supports the sustainable use of water. Green building certification systems award credits to these efforts. The LEED certification system is generally based on rules, codes and regulations that are in effect in the US. However, its credibility and popularity encourages professionals in other countries to use LEED too. For global consistency, United States Green Building Council (USGBC) is supporting regional approaches. Practitioners in some countries apply LEED as is and some have adapted it by considering regional differences caused by geographical location and local conditions. The \"\"water efficiency\"\" category accounts for approximately 10% of the points that a building can receive in the LEED system. In this study, the \"\"water efficiency\"\" category of LEED is reviewed with respect to its adaptation in developing countries.

This is certainly true from the perspective of food prices in the short run, but also from the perspective of sustainability and reducing the impact of the environmental credit crunch. The economic changes we experience now have a bearing on our ability to manage the environmental credit crunch that looms.Food Policy and the Environmental Credit Crunch: From Soup to Nuts elaborates on the issues addressed in the authors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 first book, From Red to Green?,and asks whether the financial credit crunch could ameliorate or exacerbate the emergent environmental credit crunch. The conclusion drawn here is that a significant and positive difference could be made by changing some of the ways in which we procure, prepare, and consume our food.Written by an economist and an investment professional, this book addresses the economic and environmental implications of how we treat food. The book examines each aspect of the \\xe2\\x80\\x98food chain\\xe2\\x80\\x99, from agriculture, to production and processing, retail, preparation, consumption and waste. \\xc2\\xa9 2014 Julie Hudson and Paul Donovan.\"\\n\"Donovan P., Hudson J.\",\"From red to green?: How the financial credit crunch could bankrupt the environment\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84908947844&doi=10.4324%2f9781849776868&partnerID=40&md5=d632ed26eb43c58ea0558ad30896ea67\",\"Written by an economist and an investment professional, this book addresses the twin crises that the world is facing in the form of a simultaneous financial and environmental credit crunch. Financially, consumers are less able to consume now, and pay later. Environmentally, we may have already reached our credit limit and the bill for past financial and environmental consumption is falling due. Whether the financial credit crunch constrains consumers in a way that will be environmentally supportive, naturally slowing the consumption of finite resources, or hinders any effective resolution of the environmental credit crunch is of crucial importance. Policy responses to the financial crisis are likely to be constrained by the political need to support the economic status quo, and when combined with a global reduction in available investment capital there are serious challenges ahead if the economic and environmental damage of the environmental credit crunch is to be minimised. This book asks whether financial crunch-induced changes in consumer behaviour will be enough to avoid, or reduce, the environmental crunch many believe is just round the corner. Donovan and Hudson combine their respective economic and environmental perspectives to address this key question, reviewing this \\'tale of two crunches\\' from the perspective of different economic sectors. The answer to the conundrum this book poses may lie in the only unlimited resource on the planet - human ingenuity. \\xc2\\xa9 2011 Paul Donovan and Julie Hudson.\"\\n\"Aickin C., Pollard B.\",\"Green star interiors rating tool - Ergonomic credit.

Of particular importance was reference to the use of Certified Professional Ergonomists to assess the Ergonomic Credit. Following this, the PILOT version of the rating tool was released in October 2012 and was trialled during 2013. Aims This project was undertaken to implement the Ergonomic Credit as part of the Green Star Interiors assessment and rating for a new office fitout for the international architecture and design firm, HASSELL. The project was undertaken in 2012 and 2013, and formed part of the trial of the new rating tool. Methods Methods included interviews, review of plans, observations of existing work areas, consultation with a group of employees and review of furniture and equipment considering the tasks undertaken and relevant standards. Results Seven work areas were assessed and then reassessed. Detailed review was also completed on a custom designed work station proposed for the majority of the work settings in the fit out. This review included the construction of a mock up, its assessment using a range of staff members and resulted in design modifications. Conclusions The lessons learned were many and include the need to balance ergonomics requirements with design objectives and costs, the need for early input of ergonomics advice in the design process to avoid potentially costly design changes and project delays along with the benefits of mock ups and user testing. However most important is the need for greater appreciation on the part of both the ergonomist and designers on the experience and input they each bring to the table.\"\\n\"Ramesh R., Van Goethem M.W.M.\",\"High efficiency ethylene cracking furnaces\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84907072365&partnerID=40&md5=c4000a53cdf0f514930c601e4ce51085\",\"Environmental and economic pressures generate a driving force to produce products more efficiently. A direct effect of more efficient processes is that the emission of green house gases, particularly carbon dioxide decreases. In households nowadays \"\"high efficiency furnaces\"\" are available with efficiencies in the range of 94-97%. This paper describes the outcome of a feasibility study on applying the high efficiency furnace concept to steam cracking furnaces. The high efficiency is achieved by enhanced heat recovery from the flue gases before they are released to the atmosphere at ca. 65\\xc2\\xb0C. Technip studied the application of this concept for cracking furnaces based on gas as well as liquid feedstocks. Natural gas was used as basis for the energy price. Since energy prices have a strong impact on project economics, the evaluations were done for an EU average natural gas price and a US natural gas price. Two alternative heat sinks have been considered: preheating of combustion air and preheating of cold hydrocarbon feed. Both are viable for liquid cracking furnaces. In the case of gas cracking furnaces feed preheating results in a pinch and this makes it not viable. Capital costs are based on Technip\\'s cost database and quotations from air preheater vendors. Special attention has been paid to the material selection of the affected convection section banks. This study shows that high efficiency ethylene cracking furnaces are economically viable. For Europe the study indicates an attractive payback period. In the US the payback period is longer due to the lower energy prices. If energy prices increase in the future, the concept\\'s economic viability will become better. Inclusion of CO2 credits will make the payback period more attractive.\"\\n\"Azis S.S.A., Sipan I., Sapri M., Ali H.M.\",\"The basis of property tax incentives models for green building\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905093216&partnerID=40&md5=71d968c3d554e99d8afaa82b1e821d7b\",\"The importance of living \"\"green\"\" has evolved and practiced around the globes nowadays. This included greening the buildings in order to absorb the benefits of living in green in daily life. There are lots of new and existing buildings that being transformed into green building. The development of green buildings got well supports from all channels including the local municipal. The local municipal in United States have provided three types of property tax incentives for green buildings which are property tax exemption, property tax reduction and property tax credit. Each of these models was developed according to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) criteria. Whereby Malaysia are using Green Building Index (GBI) criteria as listed in GBI\\'s Malaysia. Therefore, this paper focuses on LEED\\'S criteria that been used in the property tax incentives in order to establish property tax incentives according to GBI on green buildings in Malaysia. This is essential in order to explore the potential of property tax incentives on green building to be develop in Malaysia. Thereby, this paper attempts to determine the bases used in formulating these property tax incentives models for green building by achieving these two objectives which are: 1) to explore types of property tax incentives that available for green buildings in United States and 2) to determine the bases in formulating property tax incentives model for green buildings. This paper was focused on a 44 local municipals in United States that provided property tax incentive for green buildings.

The sustainability of these buildings should be a priority as better comfort with a high indoor air quality contributes to an improvement in the conditions for learning. Although new school buildings are often built with high standards of sustainability and energy efficiency, the existing school building stock is generally characterised by very poor quality. The energy retrofit of existing school buildings in recent years is part of the policies of the European Union and, consequently, of the Member States. However, rarely do these measures consider aspects other than energy. This paper proposes and discusses a feasibility study which provides a considerable improvement in the environmental quality of 14 school buildings located in northern Italy: the objective is to ensure the requirements for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)\\xc2\\xae certification. The analysis considers both the technical and economic aspects. The study shows that there is a technical feasibility: the credits are between 42 and 54, moreover the major cost (the cost of building envelope and heating systems retrofit is 82.9% of the total cost) is due to the improvement of energy efficiency. The improvement of sustainability is therefore a reasonable strategy even if the application of the LEED Protocol in the Italian context involves some critical issues that are discussed in the paper. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 by the authors.\"\\n\"Fadeyi S., Ustadi I., Fath H., Abu-Zahra M.R.M.\",\"Evaluation of CO2 post combustion capture integration with combined cycle power and desalination co-generation plant\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898748962&doi=10.1016%2fj.egypro.2013.06.143&partnerID=40&md5=1b5cd887573e6e22dfc19aa1c3dcc273\",\"With the conclusion that carbon capture is a viable option to mitigate climate change consequences considering the world\\'s increasing energy demand and its continued dependence on fossil fuel is enforcing the industries and policy makers to focus on CO2 reduction techniques. The exponential increase in CO2 in the atmosphere might bring some form of penalties on industries emitting CO2 in large volume and credit to facilities reducing the emission through CO2 capture or use of green technology. Due to reduction in electrical output when CO2 plant is integrated with power plants, this has been the major challenge to deploying the available technology. The integration of Natural gas (NG) power plants with water desalination plants is a common practice in UAE and other areas in the GCC region. Thermal desalination plants are the major supplier of domestic water in the Gulf region. Therefore, this research is vital to the region to evaluate possible integration of NG power plants, thermal desalination and CO2 capture. The electrical output for the steam cycle shows a reduction by 7.8% constant water production of 12.38MIGD of distillate and overall reduction of 22.14% on integrating with capture plant. The integration shows availability of cooling water which can be used for cooling processes in the capture plant. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 The Author.\"\\n\"Bulgarino N.A.\",\"Savannah River site biomass cogeneration facility\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896285804&doi=10.1115%2fPOWER2013-98160&partnerID=40&md5=d1edb32766e7ad72defc7d50b7f9ee8e\",\"Ameresco & Department of Energy Savannah River partnered together to install three biomass fueled energy plants. The main plant is a 20 megawatt steam power plant and the other two smaller plants are thermal heating plants. All three facilities are located on the Department of Energy Savannah River Site (SRS). These facilities were developed and financed under an Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC), which utilizes energy and operational savings to fund the capital investment and operations cost over the performance period. Ameresco was fully responsible for the design, installation, oversight, management, safety, environmental compliance, and continues to be responsible for the operations and maintenance of the Biomass Cogeneration Facility. This is the largest biomass facility installed under ESPC in the federal government. The facilities have the capacity to combust 385,000 tons of forest residue annually. In the first year alone, the energy and operation cost savings at SRS is in excess of $34 million. Clean biomass and bio-derived fuels (such as tire derived fuel and untreated pallets) is the primary fuel source for all of the new boilers. Biomass is used to fuel two steam boilers capable of producing 240,000 lb. /hr. of high-pressure steam and to power a steam turbine capable of generating up to 20 MW of electricity. The smaller thermal plants provide biomassproduced steam for the areas\\' heating and industrial processes. These plants satisfy winter steam requirements for both domestic heat and process steam and is fueled solely with biomass wood chips, utilizing fuel oil as backup source of fuel. Key benefits of the SRS biomass project include: Over 2,000,000 MBtu/yr. of thermal renewable energy production and a minimum of generation of 77,000,000 kWh of green power Annual Energy Reductions of approximately 500,000 MBtu/yr. No-cost Renewable Energy Credits retained by the DOE SR Support of the South Carolina Biomass Council Goals Decrease of water intake from the Savannah River by 1,400,000 kgal/yr., supporting water conservation efforts in the region Reduction of 400 tons/yr. of Particulate Matter (PM) emissions Reduction of 3,500 tons/yr. of Sulfur Dioxide emissions Reduction of 100,000 tons/yr. of Carbon Dioxide emissions The smaller heating plants include the main boiler systems and live bottom trailer fuel storage. The Biomass Cogeneration Facility includes the biomass boiler systems, the steam turbine generation system, and the facility auxiliary systems as well as the site infrastructure within these boundaries.

It was concluded that the points related to the structural credits are roughly proportional to the cost of structural elements in buildings. However, participation of structural engineers in the sustainability efforts is disproportionally low based on the percentage of structural engineers holding LEED Accredited Professionals (LEED AP) designation. Embodied and total energy requirements of typical buildings were examined and it was concluded that embodied energy in the structural components has a share ranging from 2% for traditional buildings to 25% for net-zero buildings. Finally, the sustainability aspects related to structural design that are currently ignored in the rating systems were identified and discussed. Such aspects include: baseline material usage, structural robustness and resilience to disasters, structural adaptability and reuse, structural durability and longevity. It was emphasised that a structure can be sustainable, in true spirit of the terminology, without achieving significant points in the rating systems as long it satisfies the guiding principle of reducing burden on natural resources and the environment. \\xc2\\xa9 Institution of Engineers Australia, 2013.\"\\n\"Dall\\'O\\' G.\",\"Chapter 9: Green Energy Audit Versus LEED\\xc2\\xae Protocols\",2013,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883193344&doi=10.1007%2f978-1-4471-5064-0_9&partnerID=40&md5=974afa58a32e0b80dfc2b1cbd19d6fe2\",\"This chapter analyses the activities and structures of the building with the aim of identifying the possible contribution that they can make to satisfying credit criteria under the LEED\\xc2\\xae certification.

This reduction has been achieved despite high beef and soy prices, which in previous years had pushed deforestation upward, and during the same time that Brazil made important social progress in reducing poverty, hunger and inequality. The reduction in global warming pollution that this represents is the largest contribution so far by any country, rich or poor. Several factors are responsible for this accomplishment. They include: government policies and enforcement actions by prosecutors, on both the federal and state levels; the incentive created by Norway\\'s pledge of up to $1 billion in results-based compensation through the Amazon Fund; the strong and concerted pressure exerted by Brazilian civil society on the government and the soy and beef industries; and the positive response by those industries, resulting in the 2006 soy and 2009 beef moratoria.

From a business perspective, green building certification has become an important staple for demonstrating energy efficiency, environmental stewardship, and sustainability. The LEED certification process stipulates, among other things, that points be awarded for energy conservation as well as documentation that selected indoor air contaminant concentrations are below certain target levels. (It must be noted that any decision by a builder or architect aimed at obtaining the LEED credit point certification involves some financial commitment.)

This paper focuses on five rating systems applicable to WSF: GreenLITES, LEED, Sustainable Sites Initiative, The Port Authority of NY/NJ Sustainable Infrastructure Guidelines (draft), and the draft Marine Vessel Environmental Performance Assessment (MVeP). These rating systems are integrated with a developing set of sustainable ferry guidelines in a green rating integration platform (GRIP). The GRIP readily relates credits and guidelines across multiple systems, aiding WSF in making decisions in accordance with sustainability goals. The GRIP format might similarly be applied to other integrated projects to more effectively and economically address sustainability across all aspects of projects and facility operations.\"\\n\"Cidell J., Beata A.\",\"Spatial variation among green building certification categories: Does place matter?

This review analysed the credits available in the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design green building rating systems related to the structural aspects. It concluded that the points related to the structural aspects are proportional to the cost of structural elements in a building. Embodied and total energy requirements of typical buildings were examined and it was determined that the embodied energy in the structural components has a share ranging from 2% for traditional buildings to 25% for net zero buildings. Structural strategies that can enhance sustainability but are not included in the rating systems were discussed.

These aspects include baseline system type, required plant capacities, roof albedo, fenestration exposure, lighting power densities, and many others. Additionally, the roadmap in Appendix G continues to change with each new version of ASHRAE 90.1; therefore, what worked in the 2004 version is no longer applicable in the 2007 version. Once the energy model has been completed, the modeler must determine which reports are supposed to be provided. While it is easily understood that the Energy Cost Budget Summary and the Performance Rating Method reports need to be provided, several reviewers also require additional reports concerning entered values and equipment energy-use summaries. In addition to the reports, whether any of the construction drawings or equipment submittals will be required with the submission might also be a consideration.

In the United States, more than 2,400 local communities have established historic preservation ordinances with review authority over hundreds of thousands of designated historic properties, while state and national registers encompass more than 3 million historic resources. Many owners and stewards of historic buildings are interested in green building improvements for their properties, including renewable energy options. However, confusion reigns about what is allowed by the local, state and federal agencies that have review or regulatory authority over renewable energy applications. Confusion exists within the renewable energy industry, as well, particularly when it comes to solar and wind projects. This paper will clarify the different classifications of historic properties; describe and clarify the role and function of local, state and national agencies in reviewing and approving renewable energy requests; explain historic preservation principles and how renewable energy projects correspond; and present interesting case studies, with an assessment of successes and challenges. This paper will build upon the work of others and explore emerging technologies in building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) and vertical axis wind-turbines and explain how these technologies may be suitable for historic properties and how renewable energy schemes can be successfully included in federal and state historic tax credit rehabilitation projects. The focus will be on solar and wind, which can be more challenging in historic applications. The paper will be appropriately footnoted and include a useful and comprehensive bibliography.

To provide uniformly low access latencies, these datacenters are geographically distributed and the deployment size at each location reflects the regional demand for the application. Consequently, an application\\'s environmental impact can vary significantly depending on the geographical distribution of end-users, as electricity cost and carbon footprint per watt is location specific. In this paper, we describe FORTH: Flow Optimization based framework for request-Routing and Traffic Engineering. FORTE dynamically controls the fraction of user traffic directed to each datacenter in response to changes in both request workload and carbon footprint. It allows an operator to navigate the three- way tradeoff between access latency, carbon footprint, and electricity costs and to determine an optimal datacenter upgrade plan in response to increases in traffic load. We use FORTE: To show that carbon taxes or credits are impractical in incentivizing carbon output reduction by providers of large-scale Internet applications. However, they can reduce carbon emissions by 10% without increasing the mean latency nor the electricity bill.

Prior to LEED version 3, each credit was worth one point. In this study, we develop an inverse optimization approach to examine how building designers intrinsically valued design elements in LEED version 2. Due to the large dimensionality of the inverse optimization problem, we develop an approximation to improve tractability. We apply our method to 18 different LEED-certified buildings in the United States. We find that building designers did not value all credits equally and that other factors such as cost and certification level play a role in how the credits are valued. Overall, inverse optimization may provide a new method to assess historical data and support the design of future versions of LEED.

The answer is: not very confident. In that case, what are the implications for public policy? The paper adopts a quantity theory of credit perspective as a tool of analysis. Credit creation for financial transactions drives asset prices, but the process is unsustainable. Interest rates and other conventional policy levers cannot prevent such booms. Equally, downswings are self-reinforcing and not easy to end with interest rates as key tool. A new macroprudential policy is hence required to focus on this aspect. This needs to get far more involved in the details of credit capacity and even of the sectoral allocation of credit, than has been practiced for several decades. If the allocation of credit can be biased in a sub-optimal fashion by asset price effects, by organisational and behavioural biases and by imperfect information, then we cannot exclude the need for policy interventions which offset the bias, whether by restraining some categories of credit or favouring others. This could be important not just to manage the conjunctural impact of the credit/asset price cycle, but also to ensure that important investment priorities are funded. The creation of the Green Investment Bank is predicated on such logic. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 Elsevier Inc.\"\\n\"Hylander K., Weibull H.\",\"Do time-lagged extinctions and colonizations change the interpretation of buffer strip effectiveness? - a study of riparian bryophytes in the first decade after logging\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84870347975&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2664.2012.02218.x&partnerID=40&md5=bf1b798d2b280cde1508b4239bf8aa7d\",\"There is a risk that short-term studies either underestimate disturbance effects because of time-lagged responses, including both time-lagged extinctions and colonizations, or overestimate them because of fast recovery. To evaluate the conservation effectiveness of tree group retention (in this case, buffer strips along streams), we studied the bryophyte community once prior to, and twice after logging, comparing one buffer and one clear-cut plot (0\\xc2\\xb71 ha) in each of 13 riparian sites. We asked whether time-lagged responses or recovery processes had dominated the period between two re-inventories, 2\\xc2\\xb75 and 10\\xc2\\xb75 years after logging, focusing both on the whole community and on species of conservation concern. Although there were examples of recovering species in both clear-cuts and buffer strips, the similarity in species composition to predisturbance conditions had decreased in the second re-inventory. Even if the buffer strips displayed more time-lagged colonizations and local extinctions over the later period compared to the clear-cuts, the overall species composition in the buffer strips was still significantly more similar to the prelogging conditions than the clear-cuts. The red-listed species had mostly declined during the first period, and the number of red-list species per plot (mostly species growing on dead wood) was rather stable at <20% of predisturbance levels in clear-cuts and <60% in buffer strips in the last re-inventory. Synthesis and applications. We show that most extinctions of red-list species occurred soon after disturbance and that the conclusions drawn from a study carried out 2\\xc2\\xb75 years after the disturbance did not change profoundly 8 years later. Although the species composition in the buffer strips continued to change over time, sensitive species survived much better in buffer strips than in clear-cuts, which supports the practice of retaining buffer strips for terrestrial species too. This knowledge should encourage managers to find ways of increasing the efficacy of this practice. One obvious measure could be to retain wider strips or implement other management practices that make the buffer strips less sensitive to wind, which will lead to higher tree retention to support a prelogging species composition.

One obvious measure could be to retain wider strips or implement other management practices that make the buffer strips less sensitive to wind, which will lead to higher tree retention to support a prelogging species composition. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 British Ecological Society.\"\\n\"Singerman A., Delate K., Chase C., Greene C., Livingston M., Lence S., Hart C.\",\"Profitability of organic and conventional soybean production under \\'green payments\\' in carbon offset programs\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84868349632&doi=10.1017%2fS1742170511000408&partnerID=40&md5=084bfc10bb658d374ebbdf588d6b9f35\",\"Emphasis on reducing emissions from the greenhouse gases (GHG), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) has increased in recent years in the USA, primarily for industry, transportation, energy and agricultural sectors. In this study, we utilized on-farm data collected by the USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), secured under an agreement with the USDA-Economic Research Service (ERS) to analyze the profitability of organic and conventional soybean production, based on changes that \\'green payments\\' in a cap-and-trade system would introduce in agricultural markets in the USA. In particular, the analysis focused on establishing whether organic producers would be better positioned to sequester carbon (C) and reap the benefits of the C-offset scheme compared to conventional producers, given the differences in costs, management practices and environmental benefits between organic and conventional production methods. We estimated several changes in profitability of soybean producers according to management practices, incentives for the generation of offset credits, and increase in energy input prices that a potential cap-and-trade system may introduce in future agricultural markets in the USA. Survey data suggested that even with lower yields, conventional producers could profit from converting to organic agriculture, given organic price premiums. In addition, taking into consideration both direct and indirect costs, average cost for conventional-till (CT) organic soybean production was approximately 9% lower than no-till (NT) conventional production. With a C market and payments for soil C sequestration through potential Clean Energy legislation, additional profit could be accrued by organic producers, because organic production would have 28% greater ton CO2 eq. acre -1 yr-1 sequestration than conventional NT. Thus, the environmental benefits from GHG reduction could incentivize increased conversion from conventional to organic production across the USA. \\xc2\\xa9 Cambridge University Press 2011.\"\\n\"Hunink J.E., Droogers P., Kauffman S., Mwaniki B.M., Bouma J.\",\"Quantitative simulation tools to analyze up- and downstream interactions of soil and water conservation measures: Supporting policy making in the Green Water Credits program of Kenya\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84865345915&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2012.07.022&partnerID=40&md5=ff69dc89f02deb85de0be5f97301bdae\",\"Upstream soil and water conservation measures in catchments can have positive impact both upstream in terms of less erosion and higher crop yields, but also downstream by less sediment flow into reservoirs and increased groundwater recharge. Green Water Credits (GWC) schemes are being developed to encourage upstream farmers to invest in soil and water conservation practices which will positively effect upstream and downstream water availability. Quantitative information on water and sediment fluxes is crucial as a basis for such financial schemes. A pilot design project in the large and strategically important Upper-Tana Basin in Kenya has the objective to develop a methodological framework for this purpose. The essence of the methodology is the integration and use of a collection of public domain tools and datasets: the so-called Green water and Blue water Assessment Toolkit (GBAT). This toolkit was applied in order to study different options to implement GWC in agricultural rainfed land for the pilot study. Impact of vegetative contour strips, mulching, and tied ridges were determined for: (i) three upstream key indicators: soil loss, crop transpiration and soil evaporation, and (ii) two downstream indicators: sediment inflow in reservoirs and groundwater recharge. All effects were compared with a baseline scenario of average conditions. Thus, not only actual land management was considered but also potential benefits of changed land use practices. Results of the simulations indicate that especially applying contour strips or tied ridges significantly reduces soil losses and increases groundwater recharge in the catchment. The model was used to build spatial expressions of the proposed management practices in order to assess their effectiveness. The developed procedure allows exploring the effects of soil conservation measures in a catchment to support the implementation of GWC. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\"\\n\"Kanth R.K., Kumar H., Liljeberg P., Chen Q., Zheng L., Tenhunen H.\",\"Exploring course development for green ICT in engineering education: A preliminary study\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84868029986&doi=10.1109%2fAICERA.2012.6306685&partnerID=40&md5=785461d20f9a8ef21cac5f1f862c0d36\",\"This paper aims to give an insight into the importance of green ICT course in the curriculum of Master and PhD level studies.

Computing CVA for credit derivatives is a particularly challenging problem because the likelihood of counterparty default is typically highly correlated with the size of the exposure. We show that in order to generate sufficient correlation to capture this so-called wrong-way risk, simultaneous jumps in the credit spreads of buyer, seller and reference entity are required. We illustrate this with relevant numerical examples. Closed-form expressions for the CVA in this framework are obtained in the limit of pure diffusion, and an expansion of the Green function in powers of the jump intensity is applicable in the general case.

To provide uniformly low access latencies, these datacenters are geographically distributed and the deployment size at each location reflects the regional demand for the application. Consequently, an application\\'s environmental impact can vary significantly depending on the geographical distribution of end-users, as electricity cost and carbon footprint per watt is location specific. In this paper, we describe FORTE: Flow Optimization based framework for request-Routing and Traffic Engineering. FORTE dynamically controls the fraction of user traffic directed to each datacenter in response to changes in both request workload and carbon footprint. It allows an operator to navigate the three-way tradeoff between access latency, carbon footprint, and electricity costs and to determine an optimal datacenter upgrade plan in response to increases in traffic load. We use FORTE to show that carbon taxes or credits are impractical in incentivizing carbon output reduction by providers of large-scale Internet applications. However, they can reduce carbon emissions by 10% without increasing the mean latency nor the electricity bill. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 ACM.\"\\n\"Likhitruangsilp V., Putthividhya W., Ioannou P.G.\",\"Conceptual framework of the Green Building Information Management System\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866260984&doi=10.1061%2f9780784412329.067&partnerID=40&md5=8bf60403aab440e27eb141f15e14ab77\",\"This paper presents the conceptual framework by which we developed the Green Building Information Management System (GBIMS). GBIMS is a web-based client-server system designed to assist all project participants in accessing and retrieving information necessary for the planning and control of green building projects. Its schema includes two main components: project life cycle and information. The life cycle of a green building project was broken down into the three hierarchical levels of stages, processes, and activities using an adaptation of the OmniClass Construction Classification System. Important information concerning green building project management was compiled from the LEED rating system, including credits, project participants and their roles, certification documents, design and construction standards, and green materials. The design of GBIMS follows a three-tiered software architecture, which consists of three independent modules, namely, the user-interface module, the functional process logic module, and the data access and storage module. The relations among objects (entities) in GBIMS are illustrated through a class diagram. The GBIMS conceptual framework provides the foundation for the development of a comprehensive web-based green building project management system. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 ASCE.\"\\n\"Nookala S., Said H., Kandil A., Cai H., Alderham H., Senouci A., El-Gafy M.\",\"Developing a framework for pre-design process simulation for green buildings\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866252673&doi=10.1061%2f9780784412329.171&partnerID=40&md5=92c9aaa5552445228facbea47e99ea34\",\"There is an increasing awareness towards the construction of sustainable green buildings.

Nevertheless it has been proven that adherence to LEED requirements has various effects on construction worker performance and productivity, construction cost and schedule and the environment. As a result, this limits the extent to which industry professionals apply the LEED principles, and are faced with difficulties in selecting the credits to be implemented in LEED certified projects. Therefore, there is a growing need to improve the sustainable goals by optimizing the LEED credit selection process to gain higher efficiency and productivity, which would result in increased popularity among contractors and design consultants. It has been identified that each LEED credit would have a different impact on cost, schedule, environment and the construction productivity. A considerable amount of literature has been published regarding these impact areas and it is clear that the impact is different from each credit and each project. However, very little research has been carried out that considers the combined effect of the identified factors. This paper describes the development of a multi-criteria prediction model that has the ability to model phenomena with significant uncertainty in inputs and multiple criteria such as project cost variation, the environmental impact, the impact on schedule and the impact on construction productivity. This simulation tool can be used by the design team at an early stage of the design process to optimise the benefits and minimise the negative impacts of LEED implementation in a new construction project. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 ASCE.\"\\n\"Green M.E., Hogg W., Savage C., Johnston S., Russell G., Jaakkimainen R.L., Glazier R.H., Barnsley J., Birtwhistle R.\",\"Assessing methods for measurement of clinical outcomes and quality of care in primary care practices\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84865796334&doi=10.1186%2f1472-6963-12-214&partnerID=40&md5=d185b64c0298c10b9fc8cfc5f83bf2a9\",\"Purpose: To evaluate the appropriateness of potential data sources for the population of performance indicators for primary care (PC) practices. Methods: This project was a cross sectional study of 7 multidisciplinary primary care teams in Ontario, Canada. Practices were recruited and 5-7 physicians per practice agreed to participate in the study. Patients of participating physicians (20-30) were recruited sequentially as they presented to attend a visit. Data collection included patient, provider and practice surveys, chart abstraction and linkage to administrative data sets. Matched pairs analysis was used to examine the differences in the observed results for each indicator obtained using multiple data sources. Results: Seven teams, 41 physicians, 94 associated staff and 998 patients were recruited. The survey response rate was 81% for patients, 93% for physicians and 83% for associated staff. Chart audits were successfully completed on all but 1 patient and linkage to administrative data was successful for all subjects. There were significant differences noted between the data collection methods for many measures. No single method of data collection was best for all outcomes. For most measures of technical quality of care chart audit was the most accurate method of data collection. Patient surveys were more accurate for immunizations, chronic disease advice/information dispensed, some general health promotion items and possibly for medication use. Administrative data appears useful for indicators including chronic disease diagnosis and osteoporosis/ breast screening. Conclusions: Multiple data collection methods are required for a comprehensive assessment of performance in primary care practices. The choice of which methods are best for any one particular study or quality improvement initiative requires careful consideration of the biases that each method might introduce into the results. In this study, both patients and providers were willing to participate in and consent to, the collection and linkage of information from multiple sources that would be required for such assessments. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 Green et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\"\\n\"Patel B., Patel P.\",\"Sustainable campus of Claris lifesciences through green initiatives\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862727227&doi=10.1016%2fj.rser.2012.03.062&partnerID=40&md5=82c70b3d71e586ac56d60af224be854c\",\"Aim: Acknowledging the imperative need of entrenching sustainability at manufacturing sites for economic and social development simultaneously with environmental protection, this paper aims at exhibiting the green initiatives taken by Claris Lifesciences Ltd.; a pharmaceutical company with a worldwide presence; with an aim to contribute to developing a sustainable campus.

With the introduction of carbon taxation and regulations to control green gas emissions, there is a need to expand service design to incorporate heterogeneity in carbon taxes due to regional differences. The service providers have flexibility of selecting best locations for delivery of a service by taking into consideration operational cost associated with green gas emissions. They can also buy or sell carbon credits in a carbon trading market to maintain sustainable operational performance. In this paper, we introduce the Sustainable IT Services (SUITS) framework to develop models for operational performance of an IT Service Provider in a global environment with carbon taxation and carbon credit trading markets. The models are used to formulate a revenue optimization problem for the IT Service Provider in this environment. The model solutions can provide guidance for designing operational level of different IT components and for creating effective strategies for trading in carbon markets. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 IEEE.\"\\n\"Snow N.\",\"US congress told RIN program damaged, but worth repairing\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864227375&partnerID=40&md5=2355d984c231f80b92299eed4ebc5e48\",\"Witnesses have told a US House Energy and Commerce Committee subcommittee that a federal biodiesel credit trading program, called the renewable identification numbers (RIN), can still be repaired despite having been badly damaged.

The single most important aspect of the construction phase of a LEED project involves preparation and strict adherence to a site-specific LEED action plan. The plan addresses the process of ensuring compliance to LEED requirements from issuance of a subcontract until occupancy of the building. The LEED rating system assigns one prerequisite and several credits to the General Contractor in some environmental categories: Sustainable Sites, Materials and Resources and Indoor Environmental Quality. In the LEED certification, the general contractor must not only use ecofriendly building materials, but he must also arrange a jobsite that minimally impacts on environmental matrices (water, air, soil and subsoil). This is possible through the development and implementation of LEED construction plans involving the \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 installation and continuous monitoring of specific measures and sustainable construction practices. To illustrate the contributions that a qualified General Contractor can make towards the goal of LEED certification, in this paper we introduce the successful strategies employed at two projects recently designed and constructed in Italy to achieve high ratings under LEED rating systems. The paper describes the process in the basic phases and provides specific examples of jobsite strategies that were used on two different projects and with activities targeted towards particular points on the LEED matrix. In particular the first case study is a project under the LEED New Construction v.2.2 rating system and the second is a building under the LEED for Schools.

The particles were each embedded into small pits fabricated on a silicon substrate by electron beam lithography, through the drying process of an aqueous suspension containing equal amounts of the two species. We indexed 0 and 1 for each red and green particle, respectively, and then obtained a one-dimensional bit sequence by the successive reading of the indices in a predetermined manner. We evaluated the randomness of the bit sequence by using the improved FIPS 140-2 statistical test suite. Consequently, we found that the bit sequences do not have any non-randomness. The particle array was obtained by a very simple process, i.e., the drying of a suspension, but the particle distribution pattern was definitely unpredictable and irreproducible, and the number of possible patterns was tremendously large. The signal-i.e., the color of the particle-does not deteriorate within a practical timescale under various conditions, such as in an electric field, in a magnetic field, in air or water, on a solid matrix, and so on, which means that a small tip with the particle pattern can be installed in miscellaneous object, including electronic products, plastic credit cards, currency bills, and so on.

Overall purpose is to have maximum caustic recovery with minimum wastages, minimum conversion cost & meeting all the environmental norms. The present study describes the recovery of caustic from black liquor generated out of wheat straw cooking and the challenges/problems associated with the use of wheat straw WBL as raw material for the Chemical recovery plant. The practical difficulties faced on account of high silica along with a host of non process elements(NPEs) & low GCV of straw WBL as compared to the wood WBL in the entire recovery cycle (Starting from WBL storage to Causticizing) are covered herein. The paper chronicles all the significant events and decisions taken by Trident which went into setting up the first conventional Agro based Soda recovery plant. The learnings from the operation of the old Recovery plant and how they paved way for the system modifications in the new plant is covered in the paper. There were some firsts which are to the credit of Trident viz the first Agro based falling film evaporator generating 65% solids leading to the elimination of cascade evaporator in the boiler resulting in overall steam generation efficiency. Another significant step was the setting up of a state of the art Causticizing plant coupled with the first lime kiln operating at high silica. The same are discussed in detail. Paper describes the counter measures taken to efficiently run the recovery plant to meet the Pulp Mill requirement with minimum make up & conversion cost & unique practices being followed in the Recovery Operations. This covers the process modifications and best practices adopted. Be it utilization of boiler flash steam recovery or supplying evaporator lime steam condensate directly to boiler deaerator, process modifications and reengineering are described. Best Practices involve the counter measures for the initial quality control which are needed due to constraints in the raw material or the upstream process. Some of these are dosing of white liquor in the WBL feed and the adherence to time bound hydro jetting cleaning schedules in Evaporator.

Results reveal some alignments with conventional wisdom as well as few surprises. For example, while an increased demand for major inputs is expected, an increased demand for organic manure is an unexpected positive outcome. The GR adoption rate is significantly higher in villages with access to irrigation and fertile soils and, surprisingly, in infrastructurally underdeveloped villages. Together with other expected findings of GR technology uptake with higher cereal prices and irrigation use encouraged by access to credit, tenurial status and fertile soils, our findings suggest that investment in irrigation and soil conservation, as well as implementing measures to improve cereal prices and provide agricultural credit, could boost GR technology adoption. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 Department of Geography, National University of Singapore and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.\"\\n\"Ramakumar R.\",\"Large-scale Investments in Agriculture in India\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863744496&doi=10.1111%2fj.1759-5436.2012.00351.x&partnerID=40&md5=f4775fc1127852eacd6682198efe075f\",\"Public investment in agriculture has significant poverty-reducing effects. This article attempts to analyse trends in agricultural investments in India between the 1950s and the 2000s. It argues that public investment and expenditure on agriculture in India have grown only slowly and have not decisively increased even after more than 60 years of independence. While public capital formation and expenditure do show a moderate rise in the 2000s, a revival of India\\'s agricultural growth requires a far greater thrust to public spending. Major and medium irrigation projects require special attention, as irrigation is instrumental not just in raising yields, but also the number of days of employment for labourers. Increasing public investment in agricultural research and extension is central to bridging the yield gap that persists. Formal credit flows to agriculture have to specifically target small and marginal farmers, and emphasis should move away from generating agricultural growth by channelling credit to agri-business firms and corporate players in agriculture. If India\\'s second green revolution has to contribute to an accelerated reduction of poverty, hunger and malnourishment, it undoubtedly has to be a state-led project. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 The Author.

The paper also intends to study the socio-economic variables that lead to a higher default rate. In order to do this study, the authors use a database from MIX and include some more variables. The paper intends to explore why the number of debtors/lenders is higher or lower depending on each country, and what variables influence this behavior. This will allow regions to be distinguished where there is more microcredit and on what basis and why, in some cases, it is found to have a higher incidence of default. The results showed that green cases (characterized by a lower probability of default) are increased when more collateral value is required and the case is not in Africa. Higher levels of population under the poverty line, higher levels of the Gini Index, and being an African country lead to higher levels of yellow cases. It was observed that the percentage of red cases (characterized by a higher probability of default) tends to rise if there is a smaller value of firms using banks to finance investments, if there is a reduced expression of small firms, and if there are smaller values of collateral needed for a loan.

This is because the energy used in the production of building materials and subsequently required to power a completed building form a substantial part of the overall carbon emissions generated by society.The response from both public and private sector interests around the world has been to enhance the importance of environmental assessments - both of building methods and the finished product - almost in inverse proportion to the tolerance for energy waste. The standards required by individual states vary considerably: part of this is down to local climate and geographical considerations, but a major consideration is the incentives offered for meeting a given standard. These consist primarily of tax credits and quality certificates, and the right to promote a building as \"\"green\"\", thus improving the reputation of its designers and sales potential for buyers.Some of the various Assessment organisations around the world have already franchised their standards to other countries (both government-sponsored and private enterprises) and continue to form partnerships with each other, usually in the same continent or hemisphere. The principal aim appears to be expanding the influence of that particular environmental standard. There is the real possibility of environmental assessment methods in certain countries becoming counter-productive: in the rush to standardize, actual improvements made possible by new technologies are rendered useless by political manoeuvring to make a particular standard \"\"the one\"\" to use. \\xc2\\xa9 (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.\"\\n\"Jin L., Liu J., Wen H., Zhao R., Wang M., Piao J.\",\"Construct the environmental economic policy system of Jilin Province\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84861604992&doi=10.4028%2fwww.scientific.net%2fAMR.524-527.3274&partnerID=40&md5=7b38933fa8f47574b58a2185adb16b2c\",\"During The \"\"eleventh five-year plan\"\" period, Jilin greatly promoted the construction of pollution treatment project by implementing the reduction measures, COD of the main pollutants and the sulfur dioxide emissions get controlled basically, environmental degradation get eased in some degree, but the overall environment situation is still severe.

But the adverse consequences of Green Revolution in the form of stagnation in production aggravated the problems of the farmers in the era of post-Green Revolution in 1980s and 1990s. The late 1990s witnessed an emergency of debt-driven suicides and rapid indebtedness that had taken hold of the countryside across the nation. Being the epicentre, the Green Revolution in Punjab did not sustain for a long time, as it started losing its charm and was followed by a series of \\xe2\\x80\\x98crises\\xe2\\x80\\x99, especially in its economy and environment. The farmers in Punjab are facing a severe problem with stagnation in production due to vast cereal-based mono cropping (mainly wheat-rice cycle) instead of multiple cropping, abandoning other crops like pulses, mustard, vegetables, and so on. Besides the practice of monoculture, the application of expensive chemicals (like fertilisers, pesticides, weedicides, and so on), over-mechanisation, labour and irrigation eventually increased the input cost of cultivation manifolds. Due to this high input costs of cultivation, farmers resorted to various formal (like banks, cooperatives, and so on) and informal (like local moneylenders or arhtiyas, who are commission agents in the grain markets) credit institutions for borrowing money. But due to repeated stagnation, the net output and subsequent profit margin reduced drastically. As a result, farmers could not repay the loan and eventually got entrapped into the vicious cycle of debt. On the other hand, after the liberalised economic policy of the government, the farmers received marginal importance and they could not cope up with the free and open market system. As a result, the incidence of indebtedness increased at an alarming rate. To get rid of indebtedness, many farmers across the state committed suicide. On the basis of empirical data, the present article will show the real picture of the contemporary agrarian situation in India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most-developed state, Punjab. \\xc2\\xa9 CSD 2012.\"\\n\"Gerst D.\",\"U.S. Green building top tens and trends\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862174632&doi=10.1089%2fsus.2012.9960&partnerID=40&md5=9ffb01d23a43d3b9ca3b76647376c635\",\"The hallmark of LEED and its ability to affect market transformation is continuous improvement that enables the rating system to increase in scope and stringency as market readiness and new technologies become available.

However, these are resources which can be converted to green energy. Landfill gas which is essentially methane (50-55%) and carbon dioxide (40-45%) (both GHGs) is released from MSW by biodegradation processes. The estimation of this methane and its economic and environmental benefits for environmental sustainability are the objectives of this study. Methane emission from MSW disposed of in landfills was estimated using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology. From the study, based on 8,196,000 tonnes MSW generated in Peninsular Malaysia in 2010, anthropogenic methane emission of about 310,220 tonnes per year was estimated. This was estimated to generate 1.9 billion kWh of electricity year -1 worth over RM 570 million (US$190 million). In addition, this leads to carbon dioxide reduction of 6,514,620 tonnes year -1 equivalent to carbon credit of over RM 257 million (US$85 million). These results were also projected for 2015 and 2020 and the outcomes are promising. Therefore, the exploration of this resource, besides the economic benefits helps in reducing the dependence on the depleting fossil fuel and hence broadening the fuel base of the country. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The research focuses on the evaluation of a work\\xee\\x93\\xb8based learning (WBL) module designed for full\\xee\\x93\\xb8time business students who are working part time to fund their progress through university. Primary reflective data were gathered in a structured evaluation from a cohort of 85 participating students at the end of the WBL module. A self\\xee\\x93\\xb8selected sample of 14 of these students provided additional data through questionnaires and interviews. Material was also captured from tutor reflections and some employers who volunteered comments. Recent literature on WBL was reviewed. Some recent literature suggests that part\\xee\\x93\\xb8time work has a detrimental effect on student study and attainment. However the findings of this research revealed both anticipated and unexpected benefits, not just for the students but other stakeholders. Students liked the flexible delivery and the opportunity to learn in the workplace rather than the classroom. Students also reported short and longer term career benefits as a result of doing WBL and a boost in job motivation. In addition, there were development opportunities for tutors, employers and the employing business. The research was limited to one cohort and was also undertaken by the tutors and not independent researchers. The sample was self selected and was not representative. Employer feedback was limited and possibly unreliable. However, there is clear evidence of positive enthusiasm for this mode of learning and the rich seam of learning opportunities for all parties in this mode of undergraduate delivery deserves more research. Given the economic necessity for full\\xee\\x93\\xb8time students to engage in part\\xee\\x93\\xb8time employment, this form of WBL that carries academic credit can greatly enhance the curriculum of business students. Linked to the employability agenda WBL could also be included in the curriculum of students taking non\\xee\\x93\\xb8vocational degrees and this University is currently exploring this development. Working students are offered an alternative form of learning delivery which supports their complex lives by being flexible and perhaps meets the learning preferences of pragmatists and activists more than the traditional classroom. There is evidence that students who engage in WBL are more motivated and committed employees. They have also contributed to improvements in their workplaces in areas around waste, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreen issues\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and health and safety.

LEED credit weighting provides a logical and rational approach to producing numerical scores in each category. Though it was developed in an extensive collaborative process, there has been controversy over the credit weightings system. The allocation of credit weightings still leaves much room for consideration due to the arbitrary decisions based on the developers\\' judgment. Thus, this paper attempts to address the sensitivity and reliability of the optional credit weights among six categories. We conducted two experimental designs using point-by-point data for 43 LEED projects certified under LEED-NC version 2.0 series. The findings from this study will provide the LEED project teams with insight into credit implementation in the predesign stage of potential LEED projects. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 ASCE.\"\\n\"Zhang F., Gambatese J.\",\"Subcontractor involvement in LEED building projects\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859501416&doi=10.1061%2f41204%28426%2949&partnerID=40&md5=d79c3a8cff24984f1c7cff233748ca84\",\"The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system has gained increasing attention during the past decade.

This paper describes a study aimed at exploring subcontractor involvement in LEED building projects so as to fill in the knowledge gap and to provide information for future research studies. In this research, interviews with several leading general contractors in the Pacific Northwest are conducted to find out the general contractor\\'s perspective about this issue, and a case study, the Oregon State University Linus Pauling Science Center, is used to illustrate subcontractor involvement in gaining every LEED credit. The results show that subcontractor involvement depends on the trade and the contracting method used for the project. It is also suggested that the knowledge of subcontractors regarding LEED does not limit their ability to perform LEED projects, and education for subcontractors will be helpful but not necessary in terms of LEED. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 ASCE.\"\\n\"Marzouk M.M., Abdelhamid M.S., Elsheikh M.T.\",\"Selecting building materials using system dynamics and ant colony optimization\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859478962&doi=10.1061%2f41204%28426%2971&partnerID=40&md5=a7562fd75d5570dc986d9c2c58b1c93d\",\"Buildings have a significant impact on the environment due to emissions of utilized resources. Building materials are the main component that should be taken into consideration when constructing new buildings. Attention should be paid when taking the decision of which material should be used. This decision bears significant environmental, economic, financial, and social influences. Selecting inappropriate materials can be expensive, but more importantly, it may preclude the achievement of the desired environmental goals. This research presents a framework that consists of two modules for selecting appropriate building materials in order to help decision-makers with the appropriate selection of conventional or green building materials. The modules of the framework are; system dynamics (SD) module and ant colony optimization (ACO) module. The paper describes the developments made in these two modules. The proposed framework helps to pursue sustainable environmentally friendly practices when selecting of building materials based on LEED credits and costs. A case study is presented to demonstrate the use of the proposed framework. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 ASCE.\"\\n\"Robert B., Kinga C., Gonz\\xc3\\xa1lez Mar\\xc3\\xada A., Luis R.-S.\",\"Pre-feasibility study of landfill biogas for electricity in Colombia\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073340124&doi=10.24084%2frepqj10.718&partnerID=40&md5=ccd82ca3d79f3576b8b1dec9ea4bd2b1\",\"A technical and financial pre-feasibility study of an energy from waste project in Colombia is presented.

The current carbon footprint of the global aluminum industry is estimated at 500 million metric tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2eq), representing about 1.7% of global emissions from all sources. For the global aluminum industry, carbon neutrality is defined as a state where the total \"\"in-use\"\" CO 2eq saved from all products in current use, including incremental process efficiency improvements, recycling, and urban mining activities, equals the CO 2eq expended to produce the global output of aluminum. This paper outlines an integrated and quantifiable plan for achieving \"\"carbon neutrality\"\" in the global aluminum industry by advocating five actionable steps: (1) increase use of \"\"green\"\" electrical energy grid by 8%, (2) reduce process energy needs by 16%, (3) deploy 35% of products in \"\"in-use\"\" energy saving applications, (4) divert 6.1 million metric tonnes/year from landfills, and (5) mine 4.5 million metric tonnes/year from aluminum-rich \"\"urban mines.\"\" Since it takes 20 times more energy to make aluminum from bauxite ore than to recycle it from scrap, the global aluminum industry could set a reasonable, self-imposed energy/carbon neutrality goal to incrementally increase the supply of recycled aluminum by at least 1.05 metric tonnes for every tonne of incremental production via primary aluminum smelter capacity. Furthermore, the aluminum industry can and should take a global leadership position by actively developing internationally accepted and approved carbon footprint credit protocols. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 TMS.\"\\n\"Mitchell S.O.\",\"Growing a green community\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858251262&partnerID=40&md5=0fcccbc41beb51b4986be2706376f880\",\"Ozinga Brothers Inc., the Chicago-based ready-mix producer uses its website to answer customers\\' questions about going green with concrete.

This book will focus mainly on the first, the economic crisis in which we are embroiled now. Today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic crisis is considered to have broken out following a financial instruments bubble. A financial bubble is usually recognized as an unsound hyperinflation of asset prices created by a self-augmenting, procyclical belief of people in the asset market, often originally manipulated by governmental authorities or financial institutions. As the bubble grows people are intoxicated with euphoria, but this is followed by a crash and a period of depression. For long time, effective acts and legislations prevented such disastrous bubbles. Britain was one of the earliest countries to set the Bubble Act (1720), which forbade raising a stock to prevent the formation of extreme speculative transactions and bubbles such as those observed in the South Sea Bubble. The Second Industrial Revolution began after World War I. New companies used wartime inventions to produce consumer products such as refrigerators, radios, cars, and so forth. Consumers born into the rising middle class wanted to buy these products but lacked the money, and the banking system furnished them new credit. Since its birth in 1914, the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) has tried to moderate movements in interest rates.1 In the 1920s, the FRB tried to keep interest rates at a very low level, which is believed to have created unprecedented prosperity until 29 October 1929, the start of the Great Depression. John Maynard Keynes, who did not necessarily believe in the functioning of the free market mechanism, asserted that in a slump authorities should increase public spending, cut taxes, and lower interest rates to stimulate effective demand. After World War II, Americans enjoyed mass consumption under the regime of Bretton Woods for a quarter-century. Even after 1971, when President Richard Nixon declared the end of conversion from dollars to gold, the dollar remained the international key currency and was lavished around the world, bringing global inflation. Such major high value-added production industries as steel, electrical goods, and automobiles lost their dominant positions in the United States. Then, in the 1990s, the computer and information industries, finance, insurance, and real estate emerged as the New Economy. Being free of gold, the United States now has great flexibility for financing its deficits with its own currency. Its trade partners, including Japan, China, and the oil-producing countries, have balanced their trade surpluses with the purchase of US financial assets (state bonds as well as private securities including derivatives). Americans have enjoyed extravagant lifestyles, piling on massive external debts to abroad. For 20 years before the mid-1990s, the annual growth rate of the US was around 1 percent. But after the New Economy was introduced, the rate rose more than 2.5 percent. In the 1990s, under the leadership of Alan Greenspan at the FRB, banking and securities markets were excessively deregulated. In 1999, the Glass-Steagall Act, which had regulated commercial and investment banks since 1933, was repealed. These days, people seem to forget that the effectiveness of the anti-bubble legislations have been proven by past experience. Although there should have been a sobering of the markets after the internet bubble burst in 2001, a new mania began to take hold, allowing Americans to believe that the wide expansion of real estate ownership could create the wealth of the nation. The FRB\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy credit policy, financial derivatives, and securitizations have magnified asset bubbles and brought the desperate issuance of mortgages even to the poor (just before the crisis people with incomes lower than $50, 000 had bought houses with pools, and two or more big cars). This crisis has revealed that the advanced industrial capitalistic economies are no longer able to function without booms and bubbles provoked by suspicious financial traders and securitizations of the financial instruments including subprime loans; that is, CDOs (collateralized debt obligations) = RMBSs (residential mortgage-backed securities) + ABSs (asset-backed securities), CDSs (credit default swaps), and so forth. Fictitious value in a bubble is brought about by the difference between the growth of historical trend and the growth set by hyperinflation, especially of the value of assets. It is said that at the bubble\\xe2\\x80\\x99s peak $12 trillion in fictitious value had been created, which is greater than the national debt. Historically, the price of American real estate has risen at the almost same rate as that of inflation (approximately 3.3 percent). As early as the late 1990s we could see the bud of hyperinflation of housing prices together with the big refinement of the financial system. From 2001 to 2002, soon after the dot-com crash, the FRB cut the federal funds rate from 6 percent to 1.24 percent, which led to the enormous demand for housing loans, partly stimulated by securitization and a rapid rise in home prices. The American financial crisis of this time has been called a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csubprime mortgage crisis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, but subprime mortgages were a symptom rather than a cause. The main cause was the hyperinflation of home and real estate prices. This hyperinflation, along with people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hopes for collecting capital gains through the sale of real estate, obscured the risks posed by the bubble and the potential for defaults. Megabanks, especially mega-investment banks, making the best use of extraordinarily high leverage, have spread these risks and brought the epidemic of financial crisis into the world. Business cycles have been replaced by bubble cycles. Nevertheless, fortunately a bubble often brings with it a new invention or discovery. We are now facing a so-called Third Industrial Revolution, and we are also ready for a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreen revolution\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; that is, new industries are expected to include solar and wind power, electric car manufacturing, clean water supplies, more advanced public transportation systems, and so forth. The capital-intensive industry of biotechnology will also have great potential. Vice President Al Gore, who with IPCC (International Panel on Climate Change) won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, led the development of the national information infrastructure for nationwide internet services in the 1990s. As we can see from his example, government assistance and intervention are crucial for success. Of course we recognize the effectiveness of the market system and the free competition; nevertheless, capitalism needs a steersman to conduct it in the right direction. Without such guidance, we risk the following market failures: 1 possibility of external diseconomies, such as environmental destruction; 2 insufficient information and uncertainty; 3 incomplete Pareto optimum, or unequal distribution even under a Pareto optimum; and 4 difficulty in installing social common capital (public goods). \\xc2\\xa9 2013 Selection and editorial material, Ryuzo Kuroki.\"\\n\"Clarke B., Hardiman N.\",\"Ireland: Crisis in the Irish banking system\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121895798&doi=10.4324%2f9780203095539-12&partnerID=40&md5=ab4f39c2f5277a3dfc1613d434756b85\",\"Introduction Ireland has had one of the most catastrophic experiences of financial crisis in the developed world. Along with Iceland and Latvia, also small and open economies, Ireland saw a dramatic increase in bank lending, credit extension practices, and other banking activities in the years preceding the international crisis of 2008. And as in these other two countries, a great deal of this bank borrowing came from international markets. The over-extension of domestic bank lending had already become apparent during 2007 and 2008, as bank share prices faltered even prior to the fall of Lehman Brothers in the US. In the face of the impending collapse of the domestic banking sector in late September 2008, at a panicked all-night meeting, the then Fianna F\\xc3\\xa1il-Green coalition government gave a blanket guarantee not only to depositors but to all bond-holders of the six main domestic financial institutions. At that point, the Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, claimed that this would constitute \\xe2\\x80\\x98the cheapest bank rescue in history\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (Carswell, 2008). But the government had stumbled blindly into unknown and rapidly escalating commitments. The enormous scale of the banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 losses unfolded over the following three years. The cost to the taxpayers of bank recapitalization was eventually estimated at approximately \\xe2\\x82\\xac62.8 billion (Minister for Finance, 2011); Ireland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s total GDP in 2011 was \\xe2\\x82\\xac155 billion (Central Bank, 2012). Almost half of these losses are attributable to a single bank, Anglo Irish Bank, which (along with the Irish Nationwide Building Society) is now retitled Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited (IBRC). Most of the remaining losses were incurred by the two oldest banks, the Bank of Ireland, and Allied Irish Bank. A London hedge-fund manager stated that \\xe2\\x80\\x98Anglo Irish was probably the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worst bank. Even worse than the Icelandic banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (Lewis, 2011). The incoming Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, concluded in May 2010 that this was \\xe2\\x80\\x98one the costliest banking crises in history\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (Burke-Kennedy, 2011). The collapse of the banking system caused confidence in the Irish economy to plummet. Ireland was forced to enter an EU-IMF loan programme in November 2010. By then, the systemic implications of the Irish financial sector liabilities for the European banking system meant that the Irish government came under extreme and sustained pressure not to reverse the bank guarantee (Beesley, 2011). The private debts of the failed banks were nationalized; the Irish taxpayers would be saddled with the crushing burden of debt. It has been argued that \\xe2\\x80\\x98Other countries have benefited from the Irish socialization of a large share of bank losses, which has significantly contributed to the explosion of Irish public debt\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (Darvas, 2011: 16). A large proportion of the non-performing loans of the struggling banks was taken into public management (through the National Asset Management Agency, or NAMA), at a sizeable discount, though still potentially over-valued: while the ultimate value of commercial property remained unknown, residential house prices fell by 47 per cent between 2007 and 2011 (CSO, 2012). The general public debt soared from 25 per cent of GDP in 2006 to 107 per cent at the end of 2011 (Central Bank, 2012). This figure was expected to peak at 118 per cent of GDP (and over 130 per cent of GNP1) in 2013 before starting to decline thereafter (International Monetary Fund, 2011: 14). This figure includes \\xe2\\x82\\xac30 billion of promissory notes to distressed financial institutions. The national debt, net of the bank liabilities, stood at 60 per cent of GDP in 2010 (CSO, 2011: 152). The cost of servicing the national debt increased by over \\xe2\\x82\\xac1.1 billion in 2011 to reach \\xe2\\x82\\xac5.4 billion, accounting for 16 per cent of overall tax receipts (Central Bank, 2012). How had such a calamitous situation come about? In this chapter, we show first that the conditions that gave rise to the crisis, while precipitated by international events, were primarily domestic in origin. We then trace and evaluate a number of factors that contributed to these disastrous outcomes. \\xc2\\xa9 2013 Suzanne J.

Lancaster is seeking to be a model application of the integrated municipal planning and green infrastructure approaches recently espoused in the October 27, 2011 memorandum from US EPA regarding Achieving Water Quality through Integrated Municipal Stormwater and Wastewater Plans. The Chesapeake Bay is a high priority for pollutant load reductions required by the revised total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) issued by EPA as well as the President\\'s Executive Order 13508 requiring a new strategy for protecting and restoring the Chesapeake Bay. In addition, the City is updating its long term control plan to reduce the frequency and volume of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and also addressing its stormwater discharges. Key lessons learned in cost savings approaches were identified including a public-private partnership that is cost sharing and conjunctively designing 45 integrated projects for public and private lands and relying on the use of State Revolving Loan funding to partially fund green infrastructure on private property. Private sector engagement in widespread green infrastructure implementation and methods used to advance stormwater utilities and public-private partnerships is a key implementation vehicle being used by the City for reducing wet weather pollution. Case studies were used to evaluate the impact of various revenue requirement scenarios and rebate and credit programs that will be used to incentivize private property owners to implement GI on their property to lower their storm water fee. A cost effectiveness analysis indicated that the estimated incremental cost for GI (i.e. deducting costs that would be part of other needed improvements) is significantly less than the preliminary cost for gray infrastructure (e.g., large CSO storage tanks). Further, the GI Plan is demonstrating that integrating runoff management into typical public works projects can achieve runoff reduction benefits that are more cost effective than traditional conveyance and storage approaches while also providing community improvements and therefore extending the existing City budgets to accomplish more. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 Water Environment Federation.\"\\n\"Cooperwasser V., Dowling J.\",\"Protecting stormwater utilities from lawsuits\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070357254&doi=10.2175%2f193864712811741115&partnerID=40&md5=308ca6a86f5b95df72c42a22f18d77e1\",\"The creation of new stormwater utilities in Michigan came to a halt in 1998 when the Michigan Supreme Court ruled in the case of Bolt v.

Four such programs were held at Northern Essex Community College (NECC) in August of 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. All four days of each summer bridge program were organized around the theme of the generation of electricity from renewable sources and provided an introduction to engineering design and green technology while emphasizing the centrality of applied mathematics. Participants explored the technology and engineering of alternative energy systems with hands-on activities that concentrated on Wind and Solar Power design projects. Also, energy conservation and efficiency and carbon footprints were covered. Students in these bridge programs were selected from new applicants to NECC or students already enrolled at NECC that had accumulated fewer than 15 credits and were enrolled in developmental mathematics courses. Pre and post-surveys of student attitudes toward engineering were administered in 2009, 2010 and 2010 and an independent evaluator was employed to analyze and report on the results. A summary of the reports from the independent evaluator is included in the paper. An extensive tracking of the participants in all four summer bridge programs was conducted internally by NECC and comparisons as to choice of major and subsequent success in mathematics courses were made to similar students at NECC who did not participate in the summer bridge programs. These findings are also reported in the paper. The paper concludes with modifications to the summer bridge program planned for 2012 in response to the results of the first four years. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.\"\\n\"Pantchenko O.S., Jackson P., Shakouri A., Isaacson M.S.\",\"California - Denmark renewable energy summer workshop\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029033036&partnerID=40&md5=ac64f088d3da98e314eb07b187e47aeb\",\"The California-Denmark Renewable Energy Summer Workshop is a collaborative initiative between the University of California at Santa Cruz the University of California at Davis and the Danish Universities, which students get academic course credit at their home institutions. This year the program is in its fourth year, the first and third years were held in Denmark, while the second and this fourth year in California. For the first three weeks in August, fifteen students and eight professors from Denmark and California came together to learn about and conduct research on the challenges of a rapid transition to a renewable energy society. The students come from a multitude of disciplines and the aim of the program is to train future policymakers, business leaders, scientists, and engineers in understanding renewable energy from a systems perspective that takes the technological, economic, environmental and social aspects of climate change solutions. The first ten days of the program took place at the University of California at Santa Cruz and the last nine days were at the University of California at Davis. All students lived on campus except for a few local students whose residency was within few miles of campus. The important aspect of the program is to give the students and researchers an insight into the ongoing research in Green Tech companies in Northern California. In order to meet such a goal the students attended a two day workshop on \"\"The Road to a 100% Renewable Energy System\"\" held in Silicon Valley which consisted of participants from academia, industry, national laboratories, and several countries. In addition, the students participated in touring a variety of companies in the Bay area, such as, Solyndra, Makani Power, Tesla Motors, and Sustainability Base at NASA Ames in Mountain View. Additionally the students attended lectures given by participating faculty and guest speakers, and participated in hands-on activities. In the beginning of the program, the students were assigned to work on a project of proposing a 100% Sustainable Energy Community. The choice of size and type of community was left to the students to decide. In groups of five, the students delivered proposals and made final presentations. At the end of the program, all the students were asked to answer a questionnaire and provide us with feedback. More details about the program can be found at the following web-site: localrenew.soe.ucsc.edu.

In addition to benchmarking and monitoring SME policy progress in the Western Balkans and Turkey, the report provides policymakers with concrete recommendations to move forward and accelerate convergence towards EU policy standards. This assessment was conducted in 2011 and covers the policy changes from 2009 to 2011. It was conducted at a time when SME policy was receiving growing attention from policymakers. SMEs account for the largest share of total value added in these economies, while their contribution to total employment in the private sector ranges from 61% to 81%. When the global crisis hit the region - Abruptly putting an end to a prolonged period of economic growth - many governments introduced measures specifically targeting SMEs to help them overcome bank credit restrictions and the drop in domestic and external demand. Despite growing budget restrictions, this trend persisted in the recovery phase, highlighting how governments increasingly perceive the SME sector as a driver of growth. This study follows two previous assessments carried out in 2007 and 2009. While there is a high degree of comparability with these previous assessments, a few important changes were introduced in the 2012 edition. The Small Business Act for Europe (SBA) replaced the European Charter for Small Enterprises as the assessment framework of the report. The SBA has a wider scope, encompassing new policy areas such as women\\'s entrepreneurship, bankruptcy procedures, public procurement and green growth. The report also marks the first time that Turkey has participated in the assessment, which now covers eight out of the nine EU pre-accession economies.\\xe2\\x88\\x97 It is therefore only possible to make comparisons with previous assessments for theWestern Balkans. The policy approach underpinning the SBA assessment is that SME policy consists of a mix of horizontal and targeted policies. Horizontal policies are defined as policies intended to improve the operational environment for all enterprises, such as regulatory simplification and improvement in the regulatory framework for access to finance. Targeted measures aim at specific segments of the enterprise population, such as innovative enterprises, start-ups or export-oriented enterprises. Government action should focus as a priority on the improvement of the general operational environment and introduce targeted measures mainly to address co-ordination and market failures. The report assesses the performance of government SME policy based on a common set of indicators that takes into considerations both policy components. \\xc2\\xa9 EU, ETF, EBRD, OECD 2012.\"\\n\"Kenny M., Devenney J.\",\"Preface\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925692118&doi=10.1017%2fCBO9781139003452.001&partnerID=40&md5=555a46d4e973ee79b7f2d5056b3e9cd8\",\"Preface: This book emanates from a duo-colloquium \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Consumer Protection in Europe: Theory and Practice \\xe2\\x80\\x93 hosted by the Centre for European Law and Legal Studies at Leeds University, in association with the Institute of Commercial and Corporate Law at Durham University, in December 2009.

This was part of an overall strategy to bring uniformity to contract law within Europe, as a means of ensuring a \\xe2\\x80\\x98smooth functioning internal market\\xe2\\x80\\x99. As a result of this Action Plan, a review of eight directives within the consumer acquis was initiated (the Review of the Consumer Acquis), together with work on a draft \\xe2\\x80\\x98Common Frame of Reference\\xe2\\x80\\x99. The Review did not, however, cover the sector-specific rules relating to financial services, including consumer credit. This sector has undergone its own reappraisal, as highlighted by the Green Paper on Retail Financial Services in the Single Market. The new Consumer Credit Directive, adopted in 2008 and now transposed into UK law, has been part of this process. A competitive marketplace, enhanced consumer confidence and \\xe2\\x80\\x98empowered\\xe2\\x80\\x99 consumers are all seen as essential to integration of the market. These correspond with the aims of the Review of the Consumer Acquis, which are to \\xe2\\x80\\x98achieve a real consumer internal market striking the right balance between a high level of consumer protection and the competitiveness of enterprises\\xe2\\x80\\x99, and with the approach of the EU consumer policy strategy for 2007\\xe2\\x80\\x9313, which sees the main objectives as empowering the consumer, enhancing consumer welfare and protecting consumers, all through an integrated and effective internal market. As part of the Review of the Consumer Acquis, in October 2008 the European Commission published a proposal for a new Consumer Rights Directive, which brought together various consumer rights contained in four Directives essential to consumer protection, namely the Doorstep Sales Directive, the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive, the Distance Selling Directive and the Sale of Goods and Associated Guarantees Directive. The aim of the draft Directive was to gather under the umbrella of one piece of legislation rights relating to faulty goods, requirements as to information provisions, rights of withdrawal/cancellation and the policing of unfair terms. It has been the subject of much debate and amendment. The scope of the Directive has now been \\xe2\\x80\\x98narrowed\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in that the most recent amendments, approved by the European Parliament, adopt a \\xe2\\x80\\x98targeted\\xe2\\x80\\x99 harmonisation approach, directing the greatest protections towards distance and off-premises contracts, and merging only the directives relating to these types of transactions. \\xc2\\xa9 Cambridge University Press 2012.\"\\n\"Baron J., McEnroe W.T., Poliquin C.\",\"Citizens\\' perceptions and the disconnect between economics and regulatory policy\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84919969286&partnerID=40&md5=57fcd8d6abf5310e671aa5a9b426c388\",\"The political problems surrounding regulation that have inspired this book reflect a battle over the amount of regulation. Does the United States have too much, so that regulation stifles beneficial enterprises? Or does it have too little, so that the lack of regulation permits too many disasters? We shall not address this question directly in this chapter except to point out that, other things being equal, both sides could be correct. Excessive regulation imposes costs (on someone) that exceed its benefits, and insufficient regulation allows harm that is more costly than the cost of preventing it. Each social and economic problem has some optimal amount of regulation as its solution. In the United States, it is possible that some problems are overregulated and others underregulated, relative to the optimum amount of regulation for each. The issue we address here is the possibility that both sides of the current regulatory debate could be correct at the same time and for the same regulatory problem. That is, individual regulations can be ineffi-cient, and there may be some way to lower their costs while increasing their benefits. We want to suggest that public perceptions-which affect policy through legislation, public pressure, and other ways-often hinder the adoption of more efficient regulations. Public attitudes actually prevent improvements that should make both sides a little less unhappy. Governments have several ways of controlling harmful side effects of economic behavior, which is the concern of most regulation. The typical example of a side effect that justifies regulation is pollution, but the same rationale applies elsewhere, to varying degrees. Egg farms, for instance, do not intend for their eggs to be infected with salmonella; this is a harmful side effect. Although varied side effects like these abound with many economic activities, we shall focus our analysis here mainly on regulation addressing pollution. The main methods of controlling pollution are direct regulation (command and control), taxation, subsidies for reducing emissions, tort law (lawsuits), property rights combined with injunctions as a means of enforcement, cap and trade (in which rights to emit are given out and then traded in a market), and enforcement of contracts. Contracts are difficult to make when an act of polluting increases the risk of multitudes of other people by a small amount and are rarely used, so we leave them aside here.1 However, they may be useful in situations where the potential victim is easily identified. Thus, the government will enforce contracts between the buyer and seller of a house when the contract specifies that the seller take certain safety precautions. This, too, is a form of regulation. The choice to be made among these several methods of regulation can be analyzed in terms of costs and benefits (e.g., Shavell 2004:ch. 5). In general, there is an \"\"optimal amount of pollution\"\"-an idea that sounds strange to everyone except those trained in economics. As the effort to reduce pollution increases, the cost also increases of reducing a given amount of pollution (e.g., reducing CO2 emissions). Some methods of pollution control are inexpensive, but additional reductions must rely on more expensive methods. We can further suppose that the reduction of pollution by a fixed amount has a fixed benefit. As increased efforts are made to reduce pollution, at some point the cost of further reductions exceeds their benefit. That pro cess leads to an optimal amount of reduction; what remains is the optimal amount of pollution. Given this basic assumption of an optimum, we can compare various methods for achieving it through a very simple analysis (Shavell 2004). Much of the analysis depends on information. In par tic u lar, the government may have more or less information about the effects of pollution or about the cost of reduction. Similarly, those affected may have more or less information about the harm, and those regulated may have more or less information about the harm and cost of control. In the simple case of perfect information, all methods can yield the optimum. Through regulation, the government would tell polluters what to do in order to reduce pollution by the optimal amount. Through taxation, the government would tax pollution at an amount equal to the value of the harm it causes. This way, polluters would have an incentive to pollute only when the cost of reducing the pollution is greater than the harm it causes. Similarly, the subsidy is just the reverse of the tax: The government would pay for reduction an amount equal to the harm caused. The cap-and-trade mechanism would set the cap at the total amount of optimal pollution. By trading, each potential polluter would end up paying the optimal cost to reduce pollution. Those with higher costs would buy the right to pollute from those with lower costs. A successful lawsuit would require a polluter to pay for the cost of harm, thus providing an incentive to pay for pollution reduction if that costs less than the harm. A lack of information changes the optimum, however. Regulation could miss the optimum, either way, if the government is poorly informed about either harm or cost of control. If polluters know the cost of control, but the government knows only the cost of the harm, then a tax or subsidy should work well, as the government needs to know only the cost of the harm to set the level of these controlling factors. The polluters would then be able to reach the optimum amount. Tort law with strict liability would also work, if the government knew only the harm. For torts under negligence, the government (the court, in this case) would need to know the cost of control as well as the cost of the harm in order to determine whether the polluter was negligent. Tort law requires that the victim know the harm. If the harm is a risk of some disease in the future, victims may know very little. Another relevant factor is the ability to adjust to variations in cost. Regulation is inferior to taxes, subsidies, and cap and trade because it is a \"\"one size fits all\"\" strategy. Polluters may differ considerably in their costs of control, and the other methods allow them to adjust individually so that each polluter is at the optimum. Although taxes and subsidies are equivalent from the perspective of achieving the optimum, they have very different effects elsewhere. Taxes gain revenue for the government, arguably in a way that is unusually efficient compared with other taxes because they penalize (i.e., provide incentives against) harmful behavior, whereas income or payroll taxes, for example, penalize investment or work. Subsidies have the opposite effect, forcing governments to raise taxes elsewhere (or borrow) to cover them. Most of these methods have been used or tried. Gasoline taxes have been partially justified as pollution taxes (e.g., in the increase passed early in President Clinton\\'s first term in the United States, which arose because a more general tax on energy had been considered and rejected). Cap and trade has been used with various forms of industrial pollution in both the United States and Eu rope. Subsidies for \"\"green energy,\"\" such as solar energy in homes, are available in the form of tax credits from various U.S. states. Class-action lawsuits against polluters have sometimes succeeded. And, of course, direct regulation is the approach of most environmental regulation, which sometimes specifies exactly the methods that must be used for pollution control. Economists often make recommendations based on this sort of analysis (T. Anderson and Leal 2001). For example, Mankiw (2007) advocates a tax both on the basis of the simple theory and after considering problems of international implementation. Stavins (2008) advocates a capand-trade system with a decreasing cap, a system that has many of the same advantages as a tax (except for immediate revenue). Others have advocated a tax for the United States as being a solution to the bud get deficit, thus killing two birds with one stone. But public policy seems not to heed these economic arguments nearly as much as it could. The United States is now beginning to regulate CO2 emissions largely through basic regulation, such as mileage standards for vehicles, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is considering direct regulation on coal-burning power plants. The usual excuse for ignoring economic theory is \"\"politics.\"\" Taxes or even cap and trade are not sufficiently popular among legislators. Presumably, though, legislators are somewhat responsive to the citizens who elect them. It is thus possible that citizens (and perhaps legislators as well) do not understand the economic arguments. Given that these arguments are somewhat abstract, it would be surprising if people understood them spontaneously, without training. Yet it is possible to understand them, as most of the arguments are based on simple assumptions about human motivation. Some evidence suggests, however, that people are particularly unwilling to think about incentives in the same way that economists do. For example, McCaffery and Baron (2006) found that people often ignored secondary effects of policies. Many of these effects involved incentives. Here we report four experiments on people\\'s understanding of the economics of pollution control. The subjects for these experiments were mostly Americans, typical on average in age, income, and education of the U.S. population, although there were a greater number of women than men. They completed questionnaires on the World Wide Web for pay. They were not selected to be representative, but they did include a variety of people with different political views and different levels of education. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 University of Pennsylvania Press.

This is an abstract of a paper presented at the 106th AWMA Annual Conference and Exhibition (Chicago, IL 6/25-28/2013).\"\\n\"Cohen M.\",\"The city in the global crisis: Understanding impacts and strengthening the performance of stimulus packages\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84902580724&partnerID=40&md5=6195f1a55b8c27c5018ca0ecb6afb823\",\"What had begun as a problem in largely urban financial markets in the United States had become a global crisis affecting all sectors in all countries. A crisis of capital became a crisis of labor as well. Automakers in Detroit, urban shopkeepers in Buenos Aires, Mexico City and Nairobi, factory workers in Shanghai, and rural farmers in Brazil and Mexico were no longer able to earn their previous incomes from manufacturing, agriculture, or trade. A financial crisis became an economic crisis and subsequently is also, at the time of writing, a public finance crisis. The impact of the economic crisis that began in the housing market in the United States was transmitted through channels of the real economy in Latin America in the fourth quarter of 2008, with negative impacts on aggregate production, domestic consumption, and exports. Drastic declines in private, export, and import demand began in the third quarter of 2008 and continued through 2009. Reflecting the global nature of the crisis, seven of the eight largest economies in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) experienced full reversals of exports between the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 due to rapid reductions in global demand. A double impact on the fiscal space of many Latin American countries occurred in 2010 as a reduction of demand accompanied reduced commodity prices. Lower GDP growth in 2008-2009 ended consecutive years of robust growth in LAC. Nonetheless, the Latin American economies generally rebounded in 2010 and are doing well in 2011 as compared to the United States and Europe. The global response to this crisis can be characterized as multi-frontal, with many types of measures enacted to protect banking systems and the supply of credit. But the primary measure seems to have been a set of Keynesian measures now known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstimulus packages,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d whether under capitalism or market socialism, whether in the United Kingdom or China, Brazil or Indonesia. These packages of massive public spending and other measures of tax relief and targeted assistance were widely regarded as the most effective way to stimulate demand and thereby facilitate the resumption of consumption, investment, and growth of employment. This approach was endorsed by the G-20 heads of state meeting in London in April 2009, later celebrated by the same group in Pittsburgh in late September 2009, and maintained in meetings in Toronto and Seoul in 2010 as having contributed to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbringing the world economy back from the brink\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Guha et al. 2009). While many of the consequences of the crisis still remain acute and in some cases appear significant for developing countries and particular regions within countries, there is little systematic evidence on the role that the planned stimulus packages played in either reducing the rate of economic contraction or in some cases the resumption of growth. The September 10, 2009 report of the US Council of Economic Advisors on the Economic Impact of the Recovery Package argued that the contraction of the United States economy slowed down in the second and third quarters of 2009 and that, in general, across a sample of countries, those countries with larger stimulus packages had grown at a faster rate. The report stated that three types of spending in the US, in the form of state fiscal relief, assistance to people most affected by the crisis, and tax cuts and other payments, amounting to US$151 billion of the total package of US$787 billion, contributed to job growth as well as GDP growth on the order of 2 to 3 percent for the second quarter and above 3 percent for the third quarter of 2009. The report used a counterfactual analysis to assess the GDP growth of countries, asserting that if no stimulus packages had been adopted, conditions would have been much worse. The authors concluded that these measures have made a significant difference. This upbeat message, however, preceded the unemployment rates announced in early October 2009, which showed unemployment close to 10 percent, a rate that declined only to around 9 percent by the end of 2010 and has stayed around that level in 2011. Other studies, discussed below, arrive at similarly positive conclusions, but an important issue remains as to the actual cost effectiveness of these packages, particularly in light of their scale, opportunity cost, externalities, and implications for future indebtedness. Clearly in some cases the stimulus packages did not meet policy makers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 expectations, in others they faced institutional problems, and in some countries other factors beyond their control affected key exports, trade, and domestic production and employment. In most cases, the timing and scale of \\xe2\\x80\\x9crecovery\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was somewhat of a mystery, as estimates of multipliers proved to be highly speculative. Recovery, like beauty, seems to lie in the eye of the beholder. The lack of clear evidence is reflected in an elaborate and non-stop stream of judgments, with some officials in OECD countries in 2009 identifying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreen shoots\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of recovery, and then later ruefully denying them, to images of \\xe2\\x80\\x9chope is on the way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or use of the image \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe long climb\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by The Economist (2009a). All of this highlights the prescient claims of Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman in late 2008 and early 2009 that the US stimulus package under discussion at the time was probably too small to make a significant difference, too late to forestall damage to the economy and to avert the worst effects on the unemployed, and overall, badly designed (Rampell 2008; Krugman 2009). By 2010, these claims were certainly affirmed by most analysts. A year later, with the combined impacts of the financial crises in Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, as well as unresolved fiscal policy in the United States, unemployment is still severe. Dramatic headlines in the media continue to place the global economy \\xe2\\x80\\x9cat the brink\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in late 2011. This chapter examines some of the evidence on the impact of the crisis and some responses to it through the experience of stimulus packages in order to understand the determinants of their effectiveness in actually stimulating demand. Rather than presume to be an exhaustive examination of the stimulus packages, the chapter examines these issues through the lens of the spatial distribution of the impacts of the crisis and the spatial allocation of public expenditures. The argument of the chapter is that policy makers and designers of stimulus packages seem to have largely ignored two fundamental aspects of the crisis: first, where are the areas of greatest impacts of economic contraction, and where might demand be stimulated so as to generate most rapidly the largest possible multipliers. In so doing, they proposed and undertook spending in a less than optimum targeted fashion, ignoring the spatial configurations of national and local economies and therefore also ignoring how agglomeration economies might be affected by increased levels of public expenditures. In so doing, they forget what the World Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2009 World Development Report asserted: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlace is the most important correlate of a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s welfare.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This statement is rooted in historical studies of development and the growing urbanization of economies. Historically, as an increasing share of the total population of a country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population lives in urban areas, GDP increases (World Bank 2009). This is more than an accidental correlation, but rather a clear relationship between the efficiencies and productivity of agglomeration economies and location. Agglomeration when accompanied by growing density and proximity allows the reduction of costs of production of goods and services and growing consumption by an ever-wealthier urban labor force. The process of value creation itself is a quintessential process of bringing factors of production together in time and space. Economies of scale generate higher productivity, as shown in studies in Brazil that concluded that productivity increased roughly 1 percent for every 10 percent increase in the number of workers employed in an industry or in a city. This is a very large increase, reflected in the conclusion that, by growing from a city of 1,000 workers to one with 10,000 workers, productivity would increase by a factor of 90 (Henderson 1986, as cited in Spence et al. 2008, 15). Over time, economic growth at the aggregate level is thus closely associated with the urban percentage of total population. Historically, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is extremely rare to achieve per capita incomes about US$10,000 (in purchasing power parity terms) before half of the population lives in the cities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Commission on Growth and Development 2008, 57-58). All high-income countries are 70-80 percent urbanized (Spence et al. 2008). The other important, and rarely recognized, fact is that all countries now generate more than half of their GDP in urban-based economic activities (Cohen 1991). In 109 countries with populations over one million, both urbanization and per capita income growth rose between 1960 and 2003; in the majority of these countries, income per capita grew more rapidly than urbanization (Spence et al. 2008, 7). Projections for future economic growth in all countries demonstrate that the trend toward greater concentration of economic activity will occur in urban areas of all sizes. None of this evidence has been mentioned in the daily coverage of the crisis by the economic press, whether the Financial Times or The Economist, as well as the Leaders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Statement: The Pittsburgh Summit. There are few references to the sites of the crisis that seem to exist largely on balance sheets or national accounts, but do not appear in the material world. The October 6, 2009 special section on the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWorld Economy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the Financial Times did not refer to any places, noting only that some economies have started to grow but others will have \\xe2\\x80\\x9creal scars.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lacking such specificity, this paper argues, therefore, that this coverage reflects the fact that the stimulus packages have had serious flaws in design. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 selection and editorial material, Michael Cohen.\"\\n\"Lattanzio R.K., Leggett J.A.\",\"International climate change financing: Needs, sources, and delivery methods\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84895319238&partnerID=40&md5=50243b68d420fc178ad9b6099596fa3c\",\"Many voices, domestic and international, have called upon the United States to increase foreign assistance to address climate change. Proponents maintain that such assistance could help promote low-emissions and high-growth economic development in lower income countries, while simul-taneously protecting the more vulnerable countries from the effects of a changing climate. Recent studies estimate the needs for climate change financing in the developing world to range from US $4 billion to several hundred billion annually by the year 2030. The United States has pledged funds in such fora as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992), the Copenhagen Accord (2009), and the UNFCCC Cancun Agreements (2010), wherein the wealthiest countries, in aggregate, agreed to provide up to $30 billion in \"\"fast start\"\" financing for the 2010-2012 period and to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020. Pledged funds are to come from a wide variety of sources, both public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance. Lower income countries have sought assistance that is new, additional to previous flows, adequate, predictable, and sustained.The fundamental dispute concerning international financing for climate change centers upon who should pay for it and how. The debate has been dominated by economic assessments of market- based mechanisms aimed at changing price incentives so that investment in low-emissions development becomes more attractive (e.g., cap and trade, carbon fees, loan guarantees). Many agree that private sector investment will likely have a significant role to play in any low- emissions future, and that establishing a price on GHG emissions will likely have a part in any effective policy agenda. However, concerns remain whether such mechanisms can induce the required shifts in production and consumption patterns, mobilize the necessary investment, and contribute adequately to international financial assistance. From this perspective, public funds-including from national governments and international organizations-continue to be a key driver for climate change investment, specifically in low income countries.Many methods for disbursing international climate change financing currently exist. All have a role in catalyzing climate action. They include private sector funding through such avenues as foreign direct investment (FDI), export credit markets, multilateral development banks and finance corporations, and the various U.N. Kyoto Protocol market mechanisms, as well as public sector funding through official development assistance (ODA), multilateral trust funds (e.g., the Global Environment Facility (GEF), Climate Investment Funds (CIF), Green Climate Fund (GCF)), and the concessional lending windows housed at the World Bank Group. Many contend that the financial architecture is underfunded, unnecessarily complex, and lacks both strategic mandate and adequate coordination. Debate has arisen over the proper financial instruments to employ in lower income countries as well as the role shared by the public and private spheres.Up to this point, the United States has relied mostly on direct budget appr-opriations to finance climate change actions internationally, but recent Congresses have considered several alternatives that could generate new financing for international purposes. Many in Congress and the public at large may question why the United States should help finance other countries\\' efforts on climate change. Some claim that international financing would incur costs to the United States, or redirect funds that could be used for domestic purposes and send them overseas. Others, however, contend that international financing may offer potential benefits to the United States in terms of global environmental protection, expanded commercial markets, and increased national security. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In spite of this crucial dependency, human activities are degrading the Earth\\'s environment. The degradation now threatens the wellbeing of all people and possibly the long-term survival of the human race. Environmental degradation has many dire symptoms, such as anthropogenic climate change including global warming, deforestation, water and air pollution, water scarcity, loss of biodiversity, and depleted fish stocks, all of which are intensified by an increasing global human population. Environmental sustainability is the solution to environmental degradation, and emphasises maintenance of the environment in order to support human life into the far future. There are several degrees of environmental sustainability, namely very weak, weak, strong, and very strong or absurdly strong. Of these, the overwhelming scientific consensus on environmental degradation necessitates strong environmental sustainability. Organisations are prevailing and prominent social structures that drive the world\\'s economy. Nevertheless, organisations continue to degrade the environmental during the extraction of natural resources, production and processing, and the emission of wastes. However, organisations have considerable resources for achieving environmental sustainability, in the form of technology, global reach, knowledge, power, innovative capacity, motivation, and the capacity for change. Organisational change is impacted by Information systems (IS), which have been influential in enabling and transforming the world\\'s organisations over the past fifty years. IS include information technology (IT) hardware and software, people, processes, and have specific purposes. Green IS includes Green IT, which focuses primarily on environmental sustainability throughout the IT lifecycle, and Green IS aim to enable and transform entire organisations toward environmental sustainability. Green IS present a fundamental solution to organisational environmental degradation, and researchers have developed numerous Green IS frameworks in this regard, each with a particular and significant perspective.

The average Virginia resident uses about 47 gallons (178 L) of fresh water daily (VDEQ 2008). While a majority of Virginians are provided water from a centralized, public utility, there are nearly two million Virginia residents who depend on well water as their main source (VDH 2008). Replenishing groundwater withdrawals depends on recharge (water moving from the surface to groundwater) from infiltration of precipitation through permeable surfaces in the environment; an important part of the hydrologic, or water, cycle (VDEQ 2010). Forests and grasslands provide much of the available recharge area due to their high capacities to infiltrate precipitation. However, the urbanization process is rapidly converting forested areas and grasslands to commercial, residential, or industrial developments. This conversion creates a significant increase in impervious surfaces such as concrete, asphalt, building roofs, and even compacted vegetated sites (U.S. EPA 2003). Impervious surfaces decrease infiltration and groundwater recharge. They also generate increases in stormwater runoff; defined as any precipitation from a rain or snow event that flows off of an impervious surface. As water runs off urban impervious surfaces, it picks up sediment, oils, debris, nutrients, chemicals, and bacteria. The runoff is then in a conveyance system, transported, and discharged to surface waters such as creeks and rivers; most of the time without any type of water quality treatment (U.S. EPA 2003; Paul and Meyer 2001). In addition to carrying pollutants, the runoff is also typically warmer than the receiving surface waters. The increased volume and velocity of the stormwater runoff erodes soil and stream channels and can lead to stream\"\"blow out\"\" Water quality is degraded and aquatic habitats are adversely altered (Meyer, et al. 2005, Booth and Jackson 1997). Due to the interconnected nature of watersheds, the degraded water travels downstream causing subsequent problems. The effect of increased development is an increase in stormwater runoff and associated pollutants into surface waters and a decrease in infiltration for groundwater recharge and stream base flows. Traditional practices for mitigating stormwater runoff impacts have targeted the management of peak runoff by using storage facilities such as detention and retention ponds. Mounting evidence that these methods are inadequate prompted the National Research Council in 2008 to advocate a shift to Low Impact Development (LID) practices to better meet stormwater quality and quantity management goals. LID is based on a set of techniques used in Prince Georges County, Maryland (Prince Georges County 1999). LID seeks to restore the natural hydrology of a site by minimizing the creation of impervious surfaces and increasing infiltration of runoff volume. The ineffectiveness of conventional management approaches and the implementation of the Chesapeake Bay and other critical watershed Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) caused Virginia to revise its entire process for regulating stormwater. LID and Environmental Site Design (ESD) practices are now used to design sites to meet hydrologic goals and to treat runoff to meet a net site nutrient export standard (Battiata et al. 2010). As of the date of this paper, 15 of these best management practices, or BMPs, have been approved for use by Virginia (Virginia Stormwater BMP Clearinghouse 2011). Similar approaches are being considered and adopted in other Chesapeake Bay jurisdictions, as well as nationally. The responsibility of stormwater management can be fragmented between state, local, and municipal government (Roy, et al. 2008), often differing from watershed to watershed. Because LID is decentralized, it changes the management focus from a large, regional scale to a site scale. Changes at the residential lot level can generate much greater infiltration over the watershed. Each homeowner can significantly reduce the stormwater load leaving their property, thereby improving surface water quality and helping to recharge groundwater reserves. From a green building perspective, LID techniques can provide a substantial credit under the LEEDS-ND (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design-Neighborhood Development) program. The objective of this paper is to provide a relative context for runoff at the site scale, and an overview of the available BMPs that may be applicable.\"\\n\"Zhu J.\",\"The correlated factors of the uneven performances of the CDM host countries\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863248737&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2f7%2f1%2f014015&partnerID=40&md5=e8ef98f6bd296330bf3bc1e18b722035\",\"The Kyoto Protocols Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) has experienced a rapid growth. Up to 2010, 2763 projects have been registered, standing for about 433 million ton CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq.) of annual carbon credits. However, the performances of CDM host countries are remarkably unbalanced. Previous literature suggested that economic and investment conditions, energy intensity, energy structure, the share of annual carbon credits from high global warming potential (GWP) green house gas (GHG), capacity and institutional buildings of domestic CDM governance can play important roles in promoting CDM. This quantitative analysis shows that domestic economic and investment conditions are the most decisive factors determining the performance of the CDM host countries. Additionally, the influence of carbon intensity of energy consumption is relatively modest, and energy intensity of GDP as well as the share of annual carbon credits from high GWP GHG is less significant. Moreover, several leading CDM countries are not as successful as they seem to be, when the influences of their vast territories, distinguished economic and investment conditions are excluded. Therefore, to simply transplant the CDM governances of these countries can hardly guarantee that other countries will boost their carbon credit outputs. \\xc2\\xa9 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.\"\\n\"Johnson H.J., Colquhoun J.B., Bussan A.J., Laboski C.A.M.\",\"Estimating nitrogen mineralization of composted poultry manure, organic fertilizers, and green manure crops for organic sweet corn production on a sandy soil under laboratory conditions\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84861400602&doi=10.21273%2fhorttech.22.1.37&partnerID=40&md5=909d6830b6ef3ba055a26f783b44e099\",\"Organic sweet corn (Zea mays) production is challenging for growers because of the high nitrogen (N) requirements of sweet corn and the relatively low N content of organic soil amendments. Total N supplied and rate of mineralization throughout the growing season are two important aspects in determining the optimalNmanagement program. Green manure (GrM) crops, composted manures, and commercially available organic fertilizers are used to manage N in organic production systems. Using a combination of these tactics can optimize N while minimizing cost. In this study, we used combinations of composted poultry manure (CPM) and two organic fertilizers (one high N and one with a balance of nutrients) with three GrM crops [rye (Secale cereale), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), and pea (Pisum sativum)] in a loamy sand soil for a 112-day laboratory incubation study. Total plant available N (PAN) was quantified at six times throughout the 16 weeks to determine total N mineralized and rate of N release from each of the management programs. The CPM and the high N organic fertilizer mineralized completely within the first 6 weeks of the study, while only 65% of the other organic fertilizer mineralized by the end of the study. Total N mineralized from pea grown as a GrM for 48 days was comparable to the amount of N mineralized from rye suggesting that pea as a GrM crop should not receive an N credit in field production on a sandy soil. Significant quantities of PAN were mineralized from alfalfa residue, the equivalent of 80 lb/acre, although this is not sufficient for sweet corn production. The combination of alfalfa and the high N organic fertilizer provided sufficient N for sweet corn production and the mineralization rate closely matched sweet corn need. The release of N from CPM, even in combination with GrM crops, was asynchronous with sweet corn crop need.\"\\n\"Avagyan R., Iskander W.\",\"Strategic planning for capacity in power distribution grids\",2012,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84860119901&doi=10.1080%2f21563306.2012.10473529&partnerID=40&md5=eec6d981b6c432434a69d43481cca4c5\",\"Utility planners strive to develop a distribution network which provides economic, reliable, and safe electric energy to the end users. Since the power demand has a tendency to grow, utility companies must cope with the increasing load by continuously upgrading the existing substations and power lines in the grid, or by adding new ones. An alternative solution is to add energy storage and generation sources that are located closer to the customers. This article presents a summary of a research conducted at the Department of Industrial and Management Systems Engineering at WVU pertaining to capacity planning in a deregulated environment. In this research, an integrated approach to the grid planning was considered, where distributed generation (DG) sources and energy storages (ES) are incorporated into the expansion plan together with traditional options. The objective is to minimize the present worth of installation, upgrade, operation and maintenance, customer interruption, and fuel costs during the planning horizon, while satisfying a set of given criteria.

We introduce the firm\\'s stock and a financial index in the market to hedge the credit risk and derive the price of the defaultable corporate bond by indifference valuation. The corresponding pricing formulae for the valuation are obtained by Green\\'s function approach in a unified way. Finally, the numerical results show that the introduction of the new parameters like the risk aversion of the investor and the correlation between the tradeable and non-tradeable assets may have a positive impact on the short-term credit spread. \\xc2\\xa9 2011 The authors.

Their projects are typically funded through a combination of equity provided by the developer and investors, as well as short- and long-term debt provided by lenders. Despite the political appeal of renewable energy projects and the popular perception that massive amounts of funding are readily available at the turn of a tap, developers face increased difficulty in the current economic environment in obtaining both equity and debt financing for projects. Equity participants, lenders, and other project participants are applying more stringent evaluations of the operations, finances, and credit of the developer. Additionally, because the cooling of the economy has slowed energy demand, utilities not subject to mandatory standards are less eager to pay a premium for green power. It is more important than ever for developers to explore every avenue of project funding to ensure a successful, viable project. This article includes a discussion of federal tax credits, grants, and other financial incentives available for renewable energy projects. In determining the scope, amount, and timing of their investment, project participants such as developers, investors, and lenders must study and become familiar with current and proposed incentives. \\xc2\\xa9 Energy Engineering.

This study analyzes the technical, economic and policy aspects of solar energy development and deployment. While the cost of solar energy has declined rapidly in the recent past, it still remains much higher than the cost of conventional energy technologies. Like other renewable energy technologies, solar energy benefits from fiscal and regulatory incentives, including tax credits and exemptions, feed-in-tariff, preferential interest rates, renewable portfolio standards and voluntary green power programs in many countries. The emerging carbon credit markets are expected to provide additional incentives to solar energy deployment; however, the scale of incentives provided by the existing carbon market instruments, such as, the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol is limited. Despite the huge technical potential, the development and large scale deployment of solar energy technologies world-wide still has to overcome a number of technical, financial, regulatory and institutional barriers. The continuation of policy supports might be necessary for several decades to maintain and enhance the growth of solar energy in both developed and developing countries. \\xc2\\xa9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Since it\\'s born in1998, LEED-NC has become the most famous green building rating system and made a big success in market expanding. Many other countries, including China, not only use experience of LEED-NC for reference to their own green building rating criterions construction, but also participate in the LEED-NC certification directly. But, as a green building rating system, one of it\\'s primary objective is to make clear what is the biggest problem in sustainable process. Since 1970\\'s oil crisis, resource shortage has become a common problem hindering the social and economic development of all countries and districts. Any green building rating system can\\'t avoid this reality. Using method of \"\"example points+baseline point\"\", this article makes points statistics of \"\"Energy & Atmosphere\"\" category and it\\'s inner credits relevant to building energy saving. Finally, we verify LEED-NC\\'s performance in energy saving is not so good as people\\'s expectation. When using experience of LEED-NC for reference to our own green building rating criterion construction, we must be very cautiously.

The disrepute afforded by these examples hindered low carbon growth and deterred emerging business models from adopting more carbon friendly practices. But, as this chapter argues, the shift toward liberal environmentalism has yielded a new generation of businesses seeking to incorporate carbon assets, emissions trading, and sustainability strategies across the value chain. Central to this shift is the notion of carbon as a tool for risk management in businesses, which occurred through the instrumentalisation of CO2 into a tradable asset. By utilising carbon as a financial instrument, businesses are able to manage project risk, market risk, and reputational risk more effectively. This chapter demonstrates this argument through industry examples and provides practical advice for businesses today. \\xc2\\xa9 2011, IGI Global.\"\\n\"McCarty M., Perl L., Foote B.E., Jones K., Peterson M.\",\"Overview of federal housing assistance programs and policy\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896568865&partnerID=40&md5=5587d9aa17c87259119b2157653e4b7b\",\"The federal government has been involved in providing housing assistance to lower-income households since the 1930s. In the beginning, the federal government was involved in supporting the mortgage market (through establishment of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the government-sponsored enterprises) and in promoting construction of low-rent public housing for lower-income families through local public housing authorities (PHAs). Over time, the role of the federal government has shifted away from providing construction-based subsidies to providing rental subsidies; private developers and property owners now play a larger role; and more federal funding has been provided to states and localities. Today\\'s federal housing assistance programs fall into three main categories: rental housing assistance, assistance to state and local governments, and assistance for homeowners. Most of these programs are administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Current housing assistance programs include: Section 8 vouchers and project-based rental assistance, public housing, housing for the elderly (Section 202), housing for the disabled (Section 811), rural rental assistance (Section 515 and 521), Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships Block Grants, Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), homeless assistance programs, FHA and Veterans\\' Administration mortgage insurance, and the mortgage interest deduction in the tax code. Most of the federal housing assistance programs are aimed at making housing affordable for low-income families. Housing affordability-housing that costs no more than 30% of family income-is considered the largest housing problem today. Rental assistance programs, which are the largest source of direct housing assistance for low-income families, all allow families to pay affordable, income-based rents; however, different forms of assistance target different types of households, including the elderly, persons with disabilities, and families with children. Several trends in federal housing policy have emerged in recent decades. As the focus of federal housing assistance has shifted away from construction-based subsidies to rental assistance, block grants, and LIHTC, state and local governments have had greater access to federal resources to fund local housing and community development priorities. This shift in federal funding has also led affordable housing developers to pursue mixed financing: the use of multiple streams of federal funding, state, and local funding, or private financing. Lagging homeownership rates among low-income and minority households have prompted the past several Presidents to promote homeownership-based housing policies. This report provides an overview of the history and evolution of federal housing assistance programs and policy, information about the main programs, and a discussion of recent issues and trends. It is an expanded version of the Federal Housing Assistance section originally prepared for the 2008 edition of the Committee on Ways and Means publication, \"\"Background Material and Data on the Programs within the Jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means\"\" (informally known as the Green Book).

The influence of weather or seasonality in energy consumption, particularly electricity demand, has been widely researched. A significant scientific interest in the seasonality of energy consumption has led to an important number of papers exploring the role of weather variability and change on energy consumption. Most of these papers model demand as a function of seasonal climate factors. The goal of this research is a broad examination of monthly residential electricity demand for a region of the mid-Atlantic using Excel and stepwise regression. This is achieved by using a sequence of models built in Excel in which different patterns are gradually introduced in the estimations. Data over a seven-year period is utilized. A backward elimination step-wise regression analysis is employed to determine which independent variables best model the data. Initial independent variables included high monthly temperature, low monthly temperature, time, year, month, seasonal quarter, and introduction of a \"\"green\"\" tax credit for solar and wind energy. Models for forecasting the electricity demand and the predictive power of these models is assessed. The work is organized as follows: Data description and the methodology, trend and the seasonality of electricity usage in the mid-Atlantic region, the predictive power and seasonality of the models, and main conclusions drawn from the study.

CONSOL is partnered with Green Holdings Enlow, Inc., for the project in Pennsylvania and with Verdeo McElroy, LLC. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Sindicatum Carbon Capital) for the project in West Virginia. Coal mining, and particularly coal mine ventilation air, is a major source of anthropogenic methane emissions, an important greenhouse gas that is 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide (CO2). Globally, VAM emissions from U.S. coal mines amount to approximately 300 million tCO2e (metric tonnes of CO 2 equivalent) each year. Oxidation of methane to carbon dioxide and water reduces its global warming potential by about 87%. The VAM abatement equipment to be installed at the mines will capture and destroy methane released during the mining process that would otherwise be released to the atmosphere through the mine\\'s ventilation system. The combined projects are designed to reduce CONSOL\\'s VAM emissions by the equivalent of 524,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide (tCO2e) per year. It is expected that both projects will be operational in 2012. Green Holdings Enlow, Inc., and Verdeo McElroy, LLC. will each supply capital, and they will design, engineer, construct, and operate the respective unit, and be responsible for selling the emissions reduction credits.

With growing concerns about global climate change and energy costs, the development of photovoltaic (PV) and solar hot water (SHW) systems has drastically increased in the USA to accommodate the demand for renewable energy sources. Here, we describe a collective action scenario wherein students provide expertise and popular momentum to drive policy and technology changes at the Pennsylvania State University. The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) is currently the third largest purchaser of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) among universities in the U.S. Currently, around 20% of Penn States annual electrical demand is met through the purchase of RECs. As Penn States contractual agreement to buy RECs will end in 2011, the university has started to explore several renewable energy options to offset the cost for purchasing RECs and to make the campus green highlighting concerns about environmental sustainability. The purpose of this study conducted by the Penn State student chapter of ASES is to develop a student initiative towards a greener campus using PV and SHW systems. The final analysis and report is to be shared with the Office of the Physical Plant, responsible for building management and energy policy issues for the University Park campus. The OPP Energy Systems strategic plan committee is currently seeking input for lower carbon solutions that also deliver energy solutions on site. The goal of the ASES Student Chapter is to provide accurate information to OPP such that a transition to renewable energy systems is easier. The final results of this project involves analyzing detailed energy simulations for the performance of systems, the economic feasibility and payback period for solar installations including the exploration of alternate financing options, and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for the systems and fuel-based alternatives. Dynamic energy simulations are already being developed using a new energy-modeling program that integrates ArcGIS\\' geospatial capabilities to the energy simulation.

Borrowing from ecology the theory concerning population dynamics, which shows that peaks, namely plus variants are those that carry on the populations towards harmony with the habitats and numeric and structural balances, the scientific and academic environment should be responsible for the future of our planet, for the green rebalancing, for the peace of the earth, for the stability of the people on their carefully preserved and managed land. This is why the problems of the natural ecosystems, of the environment in general, are not just forestry or agriculture or general/applied ecology issues; on the contrary, they are global problems that have to be brought as main concerns in front of planetary forums such as UN, WHO, FAO etc., international courts such as the environmental courts or the European Court of Human Rights, and state unions or regional and global conventions and conferences.\"\\n\"Beyerle T.\",\"Green real-estate funds in German regeneration: A challenging merger of economy and sustainability\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866672987&partnerID=40&md5=d7fec43f4bc7c221a58d77b079f44d09\",\"The increased global awareness of sustainability has by now also reached the real-estate sector, and this trend will lead to increases in the demand for standards, certifications and, of course, capital market products, but the effects of green buildings on rents and prices are difficult to calculate, owing to the heterogeneity of building types and the lack of long-term experience in the field. Sustainability has long since secured its place in the capital market. Expectations from green-building funds are accordingly very high: people are hoping for higher profits and a positive image for their company, and calculate that building costs are only 2-4 per cent higher than the costs of a conventional property: at first glance, a convincing story. There must, however, always also be place for a strong dose of realism: in the context of the overall market and building activities, volumes have hitherto been measured more in per mille than in percentage figures. In the case of Germany, it will, according to current trends, take about 15 years until the volume of this type of property represents a significant percentage of the whole. The possibility of promoting that evolution can be related to possible state instruments for sustainable constructions and funds. But is there a strong need for this?

However, these compost socks also can be used as a \"\"greenscape\"\" facing for geosynthetic stabilized earth structures, such as retaining walls and oversteepened slopes/embankments. Long-term slope stability is achieved through layers of geogrid reinforcement installed within the compacted backfill, while the compost socks at the face of the earth structure provide surface protection. The compost socks can be pre-seeded with selected seed varieties mixed in with the compost during the tube-filling process (along with specified nutrients as desired), or the freshly constructed wall/slope can be hydroseeded directly on the exposed surface of the compost socks.

The objective of the problem is to minimize the present worth of installation, upgrade, operation and maintenance, customer interruption, and fuel costs during the planning horizon while satisfying a set of given criteria. Thermal capacities of grid components, node voltage constraints, reliability and security, renewable portfolio obligations, \"\"green\"\" energy credits, as well as restrictions on the available capital for investments are considered in the model. Due to the numerous one-time decisions (construct or not, upgrade or not, contract or not) and the non-linear nature of power flows, the problem has a combinatorial structure, and a mixed integer non-linear formulation could be developed. To mitigate the computational burden for real size networks, a piecewise linearization procedure is applied to non-linear terms. The resulting mixed integer linear programming problem is then solved using a two-phase intelligent search technique.

Currently, the industry produces around 300-350 million tonnes (Mt) cane, 20-22 Mt white sugar and 6-8 Mt jaggery and khandsari to meet the domestic consumption of sweeteners. Besides, about 2. 7 billion liters of alcohol and 2,300 MW power and many chemicals are also produced. The industry is able to export around 1,300 MW of power to the grid. Indian sugar industry is fully capable of meeting demand of potable alcohol as well as 10% blending in gasoline. Industry is gradually transforming into sugar complexes by producing sugar, bio-electricity, bio-ethanol, bio-manure and chemicals; these contribute about 1% to the National GDP. Emerging businesses like fuel ethanol, raw sugar and structural changes in global market have provided new horizons for the Indian sugar industry. The sector today has transformational opportunities that would enable it not only to continue to service the largest domestic markets but has also emerged as a significant carbon credit and green power producer and has the potential to support an ethanol blending programme of E10 and beyond. \\xc2\\xa9 2011 Society for Sugar Research & Promotion.\"\\n\"Wankhade P.R., Shinde G.B., Sapkal V.S., Sapkal R.S.\",\"Innovative process for continuous esterification of cottonseed oil for synthesis of biodiesel\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-81455142748&partnerID=40&md5=11f0b9a2df4574f05b0986e323f63c20\",\"Due to the predicted shortness of conventional fuels and environmental concerns, a search for alternative fuels has gained recent significant attention. Biodiesel is well known as the replacement for the traditional mineral diesel fuel. It is characterized by excellent properties as diesel engine fuels and thus can be used in compression-ignition (diesel) engines with little or no modifications. Besides, it also affects a decrease in emissions of SOx, CO, unburnt hydrocarbons and particulate matter during the combustion process when compared with fossil fuels. The technoeconomic analysis of biodiesel production has indicated that cost of biodeisel will vary from Rs. 25.70 to Rs. 56.70 per liter with cost of oil ranging from Rs. 25/- to 55/- per Kg compared to Rs.36.5/-per liter for diesel. With further availability of cheap oils and taking into consideration the carbon credits earned due to green fuel under CDM mechanism, the biodiesel costs will further reduce and be more competitive with diesel. In the present paper an overflow system for continuous esterification of cottonseed oil using an economical process was developed using a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). Continuous production compared to batch production at the same condition had higher product purity. The optimum condition for the esterification process was obtained and the free fatty acid (FFA) content in the cottonseed oil were reduced by optimum esterification. The components and properties of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) could meet the standard requirements for biodiesel fuel. Eventually the production costs were calculated to disclose its commercialization.\"\\n\"Kalochristianakis M., Grammatikakis K., Saldaris M., Mastorakis I., Tzanodaskalakis G.\",\"The concept and design of an open, integrated print charging system\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-81455132825&doi=10.1109%2fPCI.2011.81&partnerID=40&md5=aba1d139206a1ba311dbd7f176445ff9\",\"High end print management systems offer integrated credit reception and efficient, parametrized accounting for the use of resources.

The landfill gas (LFG) thus released is a potential resource that can be converted to renewable energy. LFG is made up majorly of methane and carbon dioxide and produced by anaerobic biodegradation processes of municipal solid waste in landfills. This study estimates the amount of this methane emitted from landfills and its potential economic benefits. Using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology, in 2002, methane emission of 251,000 tonnes per year was estimated for Peninsular Malaysia based on 16,988 tonnes per day of municipal solid waste generated. This can generate 1.5 billion kWh of electricity per year worth over RM 450 million (US$141 million). In addition, this leads to carbon dioxide reduction of 5,271,000 tonnes per year equivalent to carbon credit of RM 222 million (US$69 million). Therefore, the exploration of this resource, besides the economic benefits helps in reducing the dependence on depleting fossil fuel and hence mitigating global warming. \\xc2\\xa9 2011 IEEE.\"\\n\"Schultz C.C.\",\"Performing enhanced commissioning design review\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-82755192485&partnerID=40&md5=2b9452ca19a706a441e21c2907ed0d57\",\"HVAC experts suggest that commissioning agents need to inspect and test building systems early in the design process.

T. Anderson\\'s film, \\'There Will Be Blood\\', and a commercial advertisement for the sale of oil, which relies on a milkshake drinking analogy. The comparison probes a tension between the aspiration for capitalist economic growth and the self-regulation of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Business figures committed to the practice of CSR struggle with the possibility that deeper, systemic forms of violence inherent in market competition supersede their attempts at installing more responsible cycles of economic exchange. A risk remains, all the while, that social and environmental concern of the kind expressed in CSR is only able to acquire \\'value\\' in the market, a relational or \\'dialectical\\' system of exchange, where it meets contrasting cycles or events in the market: the value of alternatives (e. g. \\'going green\\') is predicated on pre-existing products or earlier cycles of marketisation. The article discusses difficulties that CSR creates in terms of making interventions and raising conflict with corporate actors, and a tendency for the system to leave inert, exposed or abandoned, those that try. The capacity of CSR to eradicate the more vicious shadow of capitalist markets is challenged in the article. There is no release, the author argues, in a concept that is so essentially dependent on market mechanisms and on competitively motivated (ex)change. \\xc2\\xa9 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.\"\\n\"Wall R.\",\"Concerns about biofuels, ETS gain strength\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84903431253&partnerID=40&md5=af46f40d1d5902a270377c9648d02671\",\"Robert Wall explains why airlines may be better off buying carbon credits than chasing biofuel. When it comes to operating airliners with a biofuel blend, it is becoming difficult to find a name-brand airline that has not conducted a demonstration flight. But the air transport industry may be deluding itself if it believes biofuels are the panacea for carbon footprint reduction, at least for this decade and possibly beyond. High fuel costs as well as competing demand make it unlikely that biojet will deliver the promised carbon dioxide reductions within a desired timeframe. With biojet costs about double what airlines pay for kerosene, it makes more sense for carriers to simply purchase carbon credits in an emissions trading system (ETS) than spending money on biojet. At current prices, biojet use would equate to more than $410 per metric ton of carbon, far above the ETS market rate. Airlines are still betting on biofuel, though, in part to burnish their green credentials.\"\\n\"Leiman A., Behar A.\",\"A green revolution betrayed? seed technology and small-scale maize farmers in Zimbabwe\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80052852668&doi=10.1080%2f0376835X.2011.605560&partnerID=40&md5=960d69ac01cd7ac3eac5098aee959663\",\"Since the 1960s both large- and small-scale Zimbabwean maize farmers have been replacing open pollinated varieties (OPVs) with locally developed hybrids. By the 1990s, most were buying hybrid seed, though the adoption rates of new seed types were slowing. With the collapse of the Zimbabwean economy many small farmers returned to planting OPVs and saving seed, not only because hybrid seed was unavailable but also as a rational response to economic risks. Initially these risks were tied to Zimbabwe\\'s economic structural adjustment programme, which cut extension services, reduced short-term credit and destabilised maize prices. Subsequently risks increased as land invasions on seed producing farms forced the importation of seeds with which small-scale farmers were unfamiliar, and when escalating inflation precluded the use of money as a store of value. Control of inflation, better marketing and restored supplies of local seed should see restored planting of hybrid seed. \\xc2\\xa9 2011 Development Bank of Southern Africa.\"\\n\"Wu W., Issa R.R.A.\",\"BIM facilitated web service for LEED automation\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80053167856&doi=10.1061%2f41182%28416%2983&partnerID=40&md5=b726c1913c849120f14adbfbda55039a\",\"BIM technology has been increasingly implemented in green building design and construction, noticeably in LEED projects.

Soil classifications are useful to create systematic order in the overwhelming quantity of different soils in the world and to extrapolate data available for a given soil type to soils elsewhere with identical classifications. This principle also applies to catchments. However, to be useful, soil classifications have to be based on permanent characteristics as formed by the soil forming factors over often very long periods of time. When defining permanent catchment characteristics, discharge data would therefore appear to be less suitable. But permanent soil characteristics do not necessarily match with characteristics and parameters needed for functional soil characterization focusing, for example, on catchment hydrology. Hydropedology has made contributions towards the required functional characterization of soils as is illustrated for three recent hydrological catchment studies. However, much still needs to be learned about the physical behaviour of anisotropic, heterogeneous soils with varying soil structures during the year and about spatial and temporal variability. The suggestion is made therefore to first focus on improving simulation of catchment hydrology, possibly incorporating hydropedological expertise, before embarking on a catchment classification effort which involves major input of time and involves the risk of distraction. In doing so, we suggest to also define other characteristics for catchment performance than the traditionally measured discharge rates. Such characteristics may well be derived from societal issues being studied, as is illustrated for the Green Water Credits program. \\xc2\\xa9 Author(s) 2011.\"\\n\"Che D., Hou W.-C.\",\"A novel \"\"credit union\"\" model of cloud computing\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79960049208&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-21984-9_59&partnerID=40&md5=eb20f18efff0ce9f26c83605a54ea1de\",\"Cloud Computing is drawing people\\'s attention from all walks of the IT world.

Development of many nations in the past and the current can be traced to the importance they have placed in energy and its efficient use. In recent times, the economic prospects and growth of many natural resource companies are hinged on the availability and cost of energy. In January 2008, the South African energy supplier, ESKOM had tabled the concept of power conservation and acknowledged the energy crisis until 2016. The concept is required of all energy users to reduce their electricity consumption, intensify energy efficiency and cautiously proceed with new projects. The generation of energy results in by-products called \"\"green house gases\"\" (GHGs). Good business practice and legislation have put the onus on future-minded companies to make a positive response to climate change and their effect on the environment. In order to achieve this objective, every energy user must ensure efficient and effective energy use through technical and administrative means referred to generally as energy savings. This has resulted in a twofold benefit for increasing the efficiency with which energy is used, viz., by lowering the amount and, therefore, costs associated with the use of energy and, reducing the emissions resultant from electricity generation and the then creation of carbon credits. This paper identifies mine ventilation, in particular the electricity consumed by main fan units, as an area of potential energy savings through the implementation of a retrofit opportunity not yet widely applied in the mining industry. Ventilation of underground mines in its simplistic form involves the control of underground atmospheric environment. Ventilation systems can account for 30-40% of total electricity consumption in underground mines. For a major mining company, electricity consumed by main ventilation fans alone can be in the order of 120 MW. Although a known fan engineering technique but scantly applied technology identified as the Hermit Crab can be seen as a \"\"quick win\"\" project, due to its success in other industries such as cement and steel. The \\'Hermit Crab\\' technique\\xc2\\xaeinvolves upgrading or replacement of an impeller - whatever its origin - with a design impeller to suit the actual ventilation requirements, resulting in increased fan efficiencies. Fan inefficiencies amongst others result from changing mining conditions as the extraction of ore progresses. The cash flow benefits associated with a case study and its rollout of this technology have been calculated. For a 10% increase in main fan efficiency, would have a net present benefit of US$ 16.08m over 10 years. With the inclusion of carbon credits, this benefit rises to US$ 29.40m in total. The maximum financial benefits are in the range of US$83.5 million. Application of other available technologies, viz., composite materials, ventilation-ondemand and variable speed drives are discussed. The \\'quick-win\\' nature and simplicity of the technique and savings could aid the creation of an increasingly energy-conscious culture.\"\\n\"Zhou T.\",\"Analysis on the new changes of American green building rating system LEED2009-NC\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79959644266&doi=10.1109%2fICETCE.2011.5776241&partnerID=40&md5=32c90bbcfc2b51965cef18be4de364bc\",\"This paper made a comparison between LEED2009-NC and LEED2.2-NC from the perspective of system structure and credit weighting, and summarized the main differences between new and old versions of LEED-NC.

These SCMs are designed and implemented based upon, and LEED credits are determined by, the potential for volume and peak flow reductions. With the increasing cost of land development, engineers often choose the most parsimonious SCM design to meet the regulatory goals and maximize profitable development. In doing so, engineers tend to use only a few of the many possible SCMs to meet stormwater goals because some measures may infiltrate more stormwater per unit area than others. The amount of infiltrated water is critical because presently volume reduction is based only on infiltration. Evapotranspiration (ET) is neglected in water balance calculations and in the crediting of SCMs; however, ET has the potential to be a substantial portion of the water budget. The research described in this paper describes the development of a methodology to quantify ET and a predictive tool for expected volume reduction from ET for SCM crediting. To quantify ET, SCM microcosms were developed for four different types of SCMs: a bioinfiltration rain garden, a bioretention rain garden, a constructed stormwater wetland, and a green roof. Each microcosm was designed to mimic an existing system that is studied on Villanova University\\'s campus in terms of soil type, plant type, and root depth.

Estimates are explicit in terms of sources-green (GW) and blue (BW) water, consumptive and nonconsumptive requirements across the lifecycle, including evapotranspiration, application and conveyance losses, biorefinery uses, and water use of energy inputs, and displaced requirements or credits due to coproducts. Ethanol consumes 50-146 L/vehicle kilometer traveled (VKT) of BW and 1-60 L/VKT of GW for irrigated corn and 0.6 L/VKT of BW and 70-137 L/VKT of GW for rain-fed corn after coproduct credits. Extending the system boundary to consider application and conveyance losses and the water requirements of embodied energy increases the total BW withdrawal from 23% to 38% and BW + GW consumption from 5% to 16%. We estimate that, in 2009, 15-19% of irrigation water is used to produce the corn required for ethanol in Kansas and Nebraska without coproduct credits and 8-10% after credits. Harvesting and converting the cob to ethanol reduces both the BW and GW intensities by 13%. It is worth noting that the use of GW is not without impacts, and the water quantity and water quality impacts at the local/seasonal scale can be significant for both fossil fuel and biofuel. \\xc2\\xa9 2011 American Chemical Society.\"\\n\"Tatari O., Kucukvar M.\",\"Cost premium prediction of certified green buildings: A neural network approach\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78651423538&doi=10.1016%2fj.buildenv.2010.11.009&partnerID=40&md5=01889e18051067b64e0901e71393e1cf\",\"Built environment has a substantial impact on the economy, society, and the environment. Along with the increasing environmental consideration of the building impacts, the environmental assessment of buildings has gained substantial importance in the construction industry. In this study, an artificial neural network model is built to predict cost premium of LEED certified green buildings based on LEED categories. To verify the viability of the model, multiple regression analysis is used as a benchmarking model. After validating the prediction power of the neural network model, a global sensitivity analysis is utilized to provide a better understanding of possible relationships between input and output variables of the prediction model. Sustainable Sites and Energy & Atmosphere LEED categories were found to have the highest sensitivity in cost premium prediction. In this study, our goal was to reveal the significant relationships between LEED categories and the cost premium, and offer a decision model that can guide owners to estimate cost premiums based on sought LEED credits. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.\"\\n\"Mulder I., Koellner T.\",\"Hardwiring green: how banks account for biodiversity risks and opportunities\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84861922469&doi=10.1080%2f20430795.2011.582323&partnerID=40&md5=37acad6649aa460d0ff3dc236e535f0f\",\"This article aims at providing better insight into the way in which banks currently deal with biodiversity in their business operations, what their underlying motivations are for doing so, and how the banking sector perceives biodiversity as a business risk or opportunity. Analysis of publicly available information telephone interviews and a questionnaire revealed that only five of the 50 banks have taken considerable steps to account for biodiversity risks and opportunities on an organizational level and within lending portfolios (scores higher than 67%). Most banks, however, remain at the starting grid, with scores to address biodiversity issues on a group or holding level and within lending products and services lower than 33%. In terms of risks related to biodiversity, banks believe that their sector is primarily exposed to reputational risk and, perhaps surprisingly, to credit risk. Motivations for banks to develop policies to account for biodiversity centre on reducing reputational risk and the wish to act ecologically responsible, while being able to differentiate from competitors is seen as a major business opportunity. \\xc2\\xa9 2011, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\"\\n\"Briller D., Hamilton B.\",\"Using leed\\xc2\\xae to facilitate the eisa goal of zero fossil fuel use in new federal buildings\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79953704509&doi=10.1080%2f10485236.2011.10394230&partnerID=40&md5=0409197a7b1e644953792d703eacda86\",\"The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) introduced numerous requirements to improve the energy and environmental performance of federal buildings. Section 433 of EISA established aggressive fossil fuel reduction targets for federal construction projects which exceed $2.5 million in total cost (adjusted annually for inflation) and/or require a U. S. General Services Administration (GSA) prospectus. These reductions, measured using the 2003 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) as the baseline, begin with 55% for projects initiated in Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 and increase stepwise to 100% for projects initiated in FY 2030.The U.

It is a performance-based, quantifiable standard that evaluates the energy and environmental performance of buildings from a whole building, full lifecycle perspective. The project developer applies for points under a system of credits, which are grouped into six categories: Sustainable Sites (SS), Water Efficiency (WE), Energy and Atmosphere (EA), Materials and Resources (MR), Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ), and Innovation in Design (ID). Based on the total points earned, buildings are certified at the Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum level.This article will illustrate how integrative design strategies used to achieve high LEED\\xc2\\xae certification ratings at some federal buildings can simultaneously result in substantial fossil fuel consumption reductions consistent with the EISA objectives. Two specific strategies that exemplify this principle-under floor air distribution (UFAD) systems and daylighting-will be discussed in terms of their energy savings potential and lifecycle costs. In addition, the capability of renewable energy systems to supply the balance of the buildings\\' energy requirements (i.e., after all energy efficiency measures have been implemented) will be assessed. Lastly, key technical and cost barriers to achieving near carbon neutrality at new federal buildings will be presented, and the potential for emerging technologies to address these shortfalls (including further research and development requirements) will be discussed.

The water stored in soil that\\'s productively used for transpiration is called GW. The enhancement of GW includes all those techniques and approaches that lead to increased soil-water storage and infiltration, reduced runoff, and decreased evaporation, such as minimum tillage, mulching, terracing, small-scale water harvesting and recycling, contouring, and strip cultivation. Because rice (Oryza sativa) is a dominant crop in SA and it requires four to five times more water than other cereals, adoption of new techniques like direct dry seeding, wet seeding, system of rice intensification (SRI), intermittent irrigation, soilmatric potential-based irrigation, laser land leveling, and raised-bed planting can save 20-87% of irrigation water. Enhancing GW in soils is important to achieving a much-needed new Green Revolution in countries faced with the dire issue of food insecurity. Many water-stressed countries can produce enough food for their populations provided that the GW is enhanced and managed well. More food means more consumptive use of the so-called GW flow (vapor flow sustaining crop growth). The present level of food production requires some 7,000 km3/yr of consumptive freshwater (i.e., GW as evapotranspiration), of which 1,800 km3/yr originates from blue water use (i.e., runoff water in irrigation) and the remaining 5,200 km3/yr from direct GW use. Identification and use of efficient GW-management techniques necessitate a thorough knowledge of social, biophysical, economic, and practical aspects, and these must be in accord with the existing farming systems. A new approach to water management, integrated water-resource management (IWRM), is widely recognized as a pathway toward sustainability. The IWRM in SA countries can increase productivity by 28% to 120%, while also reducing runoff by 26% to 66% and soil loss by 20% to 43%, and raising the groundwater level by 4 to 5 meters. A policy shift is needed and incentives through GW credits must be given to the farmers for adopting and maintaining best practices for enhancing GW in soil. \\xc2\\xa9 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.\"\\n\"Ancev T.\",\"Policy considerations for mandating agriculture in a greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79952598753&doi=10.1093%2faepp%2fppq031&partnerID=40&md5=0b91a728095166e7794c29fec7652a12\",\"The question of whether or not the agricultural sector should be covered in a GHG ETS is prominent in policy debates surrounding the design and implementation of such proposed schemes in many developed nations. This paper identifies two key economic elements that determine both the costs and the benefits of mandating agriculture in an ETS. These are: the costs of reducing GHG emissions in agriculture, and the transactions costs pertinent to covering agriculture in an ETS. Published data on these elements is used to derive a likely range of the overall social costs of mandating the agricultural sector in a GHG ETS. Current indicators of those costs for agriculture, and for the other sectors of the economy, do not offer evidence that mandating agriculture in an ETS would be socially beneficial. Alternative approaches to engaging the agricultural sector in GHG emission reduction, e.g. through voluntary opt-in or through offsetting credits, are likely to be more beneficial. \\xc2\\xa9 The Author(s) 2011.

Costs and revenues were estimated in consultation with industry partners and the 20-year project cash flow, net present worth (NPW), simple payback, internal rate of return, and revenue requirements were calculated. The NPW was used to compare scenarios in order to determine the financial viability of using a generator for heat and electricity or a pressure swing adsorption unit for converting biogas to compressed natural gas (CNG). The full-scale digester consisted of five 786m3 reactors (one biogasification reactor and four hydrolysis reactors) treating a 50:50 mix (volatile solids basis) of food and green waste, of which 17% became biogas, 32% residual solids, and 51% wastewater. The NPW of the projects were similar whether producing electricity or CNG, as long as the parasitic energy demand was satisfied with the biogas produced. When producing electricity only, the power output was 1.2MW, 7% of which was consumed parasitically. When producing CNG, the system produced 2hm3y-1 natural gas after converting 22% of the biogas to heat and electricity which supplied the parasitic energy demand. The digester system was financially viable whether producing electricity or CNG for discount rates of up to 13%y-1 without considering debt (all capital was considered equity), heat sales, feed-in tariffs or tax credits. \\xc2\\xa9 2010.\"\\n\"Snow M.\",\"Accelerating the self-pay revenue cycle through e-billing and e-payment.\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79955665655&partnerID=40&md5=23bc60a5ca93bbc9721e7379b0a8a57f\",\"As consumers assume a larger percentage of their healthcare costs, electronic payment systems can provide time savings on the front end and reduce bad consumer debt on the back end.

In respect of the principles expressed by the Kyoto Protocol (KP), the CDM obtained good results both in facilitating the transition of developing countries towards better conditions and in providing industrialized nations with economically viable solutions to mitigate their Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, as demonstrated by the number of registered CDM projects and by the expected Certified Emission Reductions (CERs-carbon credits generated by CDM projects) volume. Nevertheless, in its learn-by-doing process, the CDM highlighted many limits and objectives not met. CDM was designed to ease developing countries\\' transition toward cleaner economies. It is evident, however, that the CDM in its current form is failing to achieve this. In addition, the typical and widely described CDM barriers such as the high transactions cost, the risks and uncertainties linked to the project cycle, the long lead time necessary before the issuance of CERs, the complexity of methodologies and the bottleneck existing in the pipeline of UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), has focused increasing critical attention on this flexible mechanism. The CDM incapability to meet all the objectives it was designed for, the above-mentioned barriers and the approaching expiry date of the Kyoto first commitment period, led the international climate policy agenda to include working towards a future CDM reform which should foresee the streamlining of CDM process through different forms of standardized approach. However, even if it is likely to be restyled, the CDM will not expire after the end of the first commitment period due to the legal framework at the basis of CDM (the KP itself) , and the modalities of self-funding through a charge on credits before issuance to investors, which make the CDM survival dependent only on the demand for credits. \\xc2\\xa9 2011 Offshore Mediterranean Conference.

Green lighting design practices contribute to this highest level of LEED achievement however homeowners are not always knowledgeable about how to sustain energy efficiency through lighting. The LEED for Homes Rating System provides minimal description for achieving lighting credits toward certification and little supplemental information about lighting to educate the homeowner or other lay person. As a result, homeowners are left to rely on their own consumer information with regard to maintaining an energy efficient lighting system and over time can become less satisfied with the aesthetic and functional results. This paper reviews and examines an educational experience across interior design and architectural technology disciplines to learn about energy efficient lighting and apply it in a consumer education effort. Specifically, it describes the pedagogy of a design project where students apply concepts and technologies of current lighting trends in energy efficiency to the practice of implementing and maintaining successful lighting systems. The project focuses on: 1. Identifying current LEED Platinum certification for Homes, 2. Correlating LEED standards to appropriate lighting design strategies, 3. Designing an energy efficient lighting system for new Habitat for Humanity construction, and 4. Creating and delivering consumer education for homeowners to successfully maintain their lighting system. The pedagogical discussion focuses on the appropriate combination of the art and science of lighting so that students design functionally effective lighting systems that are also aesthetically pleasing to homeowners. Through this approach, homeowners are more likely to continue maintaining their system when it is one that provides pleasing, effective, and energy efficient lighting. Students then educate homeowners in the effective selection of lamps, considering cost and characteristics, as well as maintenance strategies to keep lighting optimally functional. Students apply a foundation of lighting education to ever-changing lighting technology and how it can effectively apply to the consumer. Literature reviews of consumer education efforts in new lighting technologies combined with student research of LEED standards in Habitat for Humanity construction address the need for consumer-friendly lighting education. With upcoming U.S. legislation for increased efficiency of incandescent lighting, students learn how to address public education efforts to realize energy savings. Their contributions to environmental sustainability are measured by homeowner response to education and maintenance strategies that students create. Through this interdisciplinary approach, students of interior design and architectural technology build upon the strengths of each discipline to engage in a viable design and teaching opportunity that realizes measurable impact in sustainable practices. \\xc2\\xa9 2011 American Society for Engineering Education.\"\\n\"Riggins G.B., Lohani V.K.\",\"International experiences of a US undergraduate student in exchange programs in France and Brazil\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029030520&partnerID=40&md5=6639217ff533fb1fb486cb9c9dfd90a7\",\"This paper documents one year-long study abroad experiences, each in France and Brazil, of a civil engineering undergraduate at Virginia Tech.

After consultations failed to resolve their concerns, both countries (again acting independently) requested the establishment of a WTO panel to rule on their complaints. The WTO\\'s Dispute Settlement Body, on December 17, 2007, established a single panel to consider both cases. In late April 2008, Brazil and Canada informally agreed to postpone proceeding with their joint World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement case challenging certain U.S. agricultural subsidies. At the time of the postponement, the three parties involved in the dispute had been unable to agree on panel membership. The postponement was thought to be provisional based on success in achieving further disciplines on domestic support in the current Doha Round of WTO trade negotiations. However, the Doha Round negotiations failed to complete an agreement in 2009. As of early 2010 there are no prospects for revival of Doha Round negotiations. Nor have Brazil and Canada given any indication that they will revive their pursuit of their joint case. It is not clear how long the postponement will persist. If resumed, the first order of business will be the formation of a panel. The joint case combines two separate but similar cases: DS357, brought by Canada, and DS365, brought by Brazil. Both cases make two charges against U.S. farm programs-first, that the United States has exceeded its annual WTO commitment levels for total aggregate measurement of support (AMS) for agriculture in each of the years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2005, and second, that the U.S. export credit guarantee program for agricultural commodities operates as a WTO-illegal export subsidy. Both charges stem, in large part, from a previous negative ruling against U.S. farm programs in a case (DS267) brought by Brazil against the U.S. cotton program. In that case, a WTO panel ruled (the ruling subsequently was upheld by a WTO Appellate Body), first, that direct payments made under U.S. farm programs do not qualify for green box exemption status because of a restriction prohibiting the planting of fruits, vegetables, or wild rice on payment acres; and second, that the U.S. export credit guarantee program operates as a prohibited export subsidy program because the financial benefits returned by these programs failed to cover their long-run operating costs. As a result of the ruling, U.S. export credit guarantees became subject to previously scheduled export subsidy commitments. For more information, see CRS Report RL32571, Brazil\\'s WTO Case Against the U.S. Cotton Program, by Randy Schnepf. Canada and Brazil claim that, since they fail to qualify for inclusion in the green box, U.S. direct payments should be added to its AMS when calculating total domestic support. In addition, they also charge that the United States has improperly notified several of its farm support programs as exempt from the AMS limit, while several other programs were improperly excluded from U.S. notifications. Canada and Brazil claim that when all of the outlays from these allegedly misnotified programs are included, then the U.S. AMS total exceeds its WTO commitment level. Should a panel be formed and eventually rule on this case, any changes in U.S. farm policy needed to comply with a WTO ruling against the United States would likely involve action by Congress to produce new legislation.This report provides background and details, as well as the current status of the two WTO dispute settlement cases.

The Administration shifted toward building a multilateral coalition for additional U.N. sanctions, and apparently prompted the Defense Department to try to develop additional options for preventing or containing a nuclear Iran. The Administration efforts bore fruit on May 18, 2010, when it announced an agreement among permanent members of the U.N. Security Council that would authorize, but not require, countries to take a number of significant steps against Iran, including banning major arms sales to Iran and authorizing inspection of ships suspected of carrying equipment for Iran\\'s nuclear program. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 containing these provisions was passed on June 9 by a vote of 12-2 with one abstention. The Resolution represented a rejection of a May 17, 2010, agreement brokered by Brazil and Turkey to implement major features of the October 1, 2009, agreement. The newly agreed-to U.N. Security Council sanctions build on those in place since 2006. Those sanctions generally are targeted against WMD-related trade with Iran, but also ban Iran from transferring arms outside Iran and restrict dealings with some Iranian banks. Separate U.S. efforts to persuade European governments to curb trade with, investment in, and credits for Iran, and to convince foreign banks not to do business with Iran, are intended to compound the U.N. pressure. In the 111th Congress, conference action is underway on legislation to try to curb sales to Iran of gasoline, which many Members believe could help pressure Iran into a nuclear settlement or undermine the regime\\'s popularity even further. Others believe such steps could help the regime rebuild its support by painting the international community as punitive against the Iranian people. Some believe that the domestic opposition, which in late 2009 appeared to pose a potentially serious challenge to the regime\\'s grip on power, may eventually present the United States with an opportunity to see the regime replaced or modified substantially. Obama Administration officials appear to believe that the opposition\\'s prospects are enhanced by a low U.S. public profile on the unrest. Congressional resolutions and legislation since mid-2009 show growing congressional support for steps to enhance the opposition\\'s prospects. For further information, see CRS Report RS20871, Iran Sanctions; CRS Report R40849, Iran: Regional Perspectives and U.S. Policy; and CRS Report RL34544, Iran\\'s Nuclear Program: Status. Much of the debate over U.S. policy toward Iran has centered on the nature of the current regime; some believe that Iran, a country of about 70 million people, is a threat to U.S. interests because hardliners in Iran\\'s regime dominate and set a policy direction intended to challenge U.S. influence and allies in the region. President George W. Bush, in his January 29, 2002, State of the Union message, labeled Iran part of an \"\"axis of evil\"\" along with Iraq and North Korea. \\xc2\\xa9 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This book emerges from a duo-colloquium \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\xe2\\x80\\x98The Europeanisation of Private Law: Theory and Practice\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 hosted by the Research Group on Credit, Debt and Consumer Protection at Leicester University, in association with the Institute of Commercial and Corporate Law at Durham University, in December 2010. That conference explored the Europeanisation of private law against the backdrop of a changing Europe and in the context of the (then) proposed Consumer Rights Directive, efforts to consolidate the consumer acquis, the draft Common Frame of Reference, the Commission\\'s appointment of an Expert Group on a Common Frame of Reference in the area of European contract law, and the Commission Green Paper on Policy Options for Progress towards a European Contract Law for Consumers and Businesses. The issues explored by that conference are even more relevant today given, for example, the passage of the Consumer Rights Directive, the proposal for an optional Common European Sales Law and renewed debate on a European Civil Code. However, much work is yet to be done, as is highlighted by the early response of the Council of the European Union on Justice and Home Affairs to the proposal for an optional Common European Sales Law: Among the aspects of the proposal that require thorough discussion are the personal, material and territorial scope of the proposal, the complexity of linking the proposal with the different national legal systems, the details and consequences of choice of the instrument, the consequences of an invalid choice, the consumer protection rules relating to the choice and the reporting obligations of member states, including the envisaged online database of judgments. Indeed, we may now be at a watershed moment in the Europeanisation of private law and this book, with fully updated contributions, critically reflects on whether the process of Europeanisation, which has shaped private law in the EU Member States, has now reached a critical turning point in its development, a point of punctuated equilibrium, with significant policy implications for EU law, national laws and the principle of subsidiarity. \\xc2\\xa9 Cambridge University Press 2013.\"\\n\"Mahoney J., Galdiz I.\",\"The US perspective on export credits going green\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84908916290&doi=10.1787%2f9789264111745-36-en&partnerID=40&md5=abc9666c734128dd2d5ab33306192ff2\",\"Global attention to problems of environmental protection and socio-economic development had been heightened following the first international Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. The Rio Summit was an extraordinary event attended by 108 Heads of State that drew attention to issues ranging from biodiversity and climate change to the state of the world\\'s resources of water and forests. OECD governments, as providers of export credits, meanwhile had been taking steps to address domestic environmental issues through regulations aimed at pollution control and policies directed at adverse environmental impact mitigation of domestic industrial activities. Awareness now was turning to the environmental conditions in non-OECD countries and the role being played by international financial institutions in these developing nations that were recipients of export credits. Pressure from public stakeholders and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) was mounting on international financial institutions to adopt measures to address the environmental and social impacts of the projects they finance. \\xc2\\xa9 OECD 2011.\"\\n\"Wang H., Jiang H., Wang J.\",\"Environmental protection in China\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892202256&partnerID=40&md5=ce0674a244d1b1f2165ad88e45f685e9\",\"China has been very successful in developing its economy in the past 30 years. However, the severe environmental deteriorations associated with the rapid economic growth have generated serious concerns. Even though some analyses show that the economic development in China is not necessarily unsustainable after taking into consideration of its environment and natural resources, the environmental deteriorations have caused significant damages to its economy and its socio-welfare, and undermined its economic achievements. However, strong efforts and significant achievements have been observed in the work of environmental protection in China, especially in the past 10 years. The environmental institutions have been continuously improving; the investment in environmental protection has kept increasing; and the pollution intensity has kept reducing. It is fair to say that, without those efforts and achievements, the environmental quality in China could have been much worse than that of today. It should also be fair to say that the environmental efforts and achievements in China in the past were not enough, as witnessed by the unbearable pollution levels in the air, water and land, by the worrisome ecological degradations, by the economic damages and the social conflicts that the environmental problems caused to the current generation, as well as by the potential constraints that the current environmental issues post to the economic development in the future. Major issues associated with the current environmental protection system in China rest mostly in the enforcement. Some rather advanced concepts and policy instruments for environmental protection, such as mainstreaming environmental protection, integration of environment and development, polluters\\' pay principle, sustainable development, cleaner production, circular economy, information disclosure, etc., have been developed and adopted in China. A comprehensive legal system and organizational structure have been set up. However, those legal and regulatory instruments are found not well implemented, and the compliance has lagged far behind. Violations of regulations are found everywhere. A lesson that one may learn from the Chinese environmental protection experiences may be that a strong participation of the general public in the environmental agenda and/or a strong political will of the central government for environmental protection are necessary in order to have an efficient balance between economic growth and environmental protection, especially when the desire for economic growth is very strong and the political system is not well advanced. This paper first presents the environmental quality and pollution emission trends in the past as well as the protection efforts. One can see that, while the overall environmental situation is still very serious, there are indications of improvements in certain aspects and in certain areas. This paper focuses on water environment, air quality and solid waste in the past 30 years, especially the past 10 years when the detailed data are available. During the review of the trends, extensive discussions are also made on major challenges in the environmental issues. It is observed that the energy intensity of Chinese economy has been continuously decreasing and the discharge intensities of major pollutants have reduced year after year, but they have not reached the world average level. In more than three decades, China\\'s effort in protecting the environment has been evolving and become stronger and stronger. Currently, environmental awareness is high, governmental organizations for environmental protection have been fully established, environmental laws and regulations are close to mature, and a comprehensive environmental policy system has been established. Investment in environmental protection keeps increasing. International cooperation is much stronger. A comprehensive evaluation of all major countermeasures to environmental problems that China has employed in the past 30 years is provided in this paper. They include principles and strategies that Chinese Communist Party and the government established, laws and regulations that were enacted by Chinese regulatory authorities, as well as policies, standards and decisions that the government authorities used to manage the environment. The characteristics of Chinese environmental policy making are found to include: 1) balance between environment and economic development; 2) balance between prevention and end-of-pipe treatment; 3) use of both conventional command & control approaches and economic instruments; 4) emphases on government actions. And, the future institutional challenges are identified to include: 1) some advanced concepts are well developed but not well implemented; 2) coordination between different departments of government is weak; 3) legal system is incomplete; and 4) policy enforcement and compliance are weak. Major policy instruments reviewed include: 1) command & control measures, including Environmental planning, environmental impact assessment and \"\"three simultaneities,\"\" total pollution load control, pollution treatment deadline, and pollution discharge permit system; 2) economic policies, including pollution levy, user charge, pollution permit trading, environmental tax, ecological compensation, green credit and green security; and 3) voluntary measures, including environmental information disclosure, environmental management system , cleaner production audit, and eco-labeling product. Several potentially positive experiences in the work of environmental protection in China have also been identified, which include 1) The environmental zoning policy; 2) the requirements of environmental impact assessment; 3) the pollution levy system; 4) The approach of performance rating and public disclosure, 5) the community environmental dialogue. \\xc2\\xa9 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Green building rating systems have been instrumental in driving this front. Increasing number of green rated buildings and the national and international level rating systems speak for the importance of green buildings. A majority if not all rating systems are established on the same fundamental principles which are reflected in their credit categories, credit distribution and weighting. Life Cycle Assessment has been adopted in LEED rating system to rationalize the possible impacts and hence the credit weighting. Although the logic is well rationalized, this distribution is not reflected in actual practice due to many reasons such as cost implications, practical limitations and regional variations. Therefore certain credit categories that are most prevalent in LEED rated projects in the US might not be reflected important in LEED rated projects in Asia. Considering the rapidly progressing adaptation of LEED system in Asia, this paper intends to explore adaptation trends in LEED system comparing projects in the US and in Asia. Our study analyses fifty urban office projects in the US and in Asia that have achieved either Gold or Platinum level rating under LEED for New Construction and Major Renovations rating system version 2 and 2.2. Size of the projects will be determined by benchmarks specified by Core & Shell system. Data will be primarily obtained from LEED score sheets. Data will be analysed based on simple statistical analysis methods. Findings are expected to reflect how rating system requirements are adopted in practice, and regional trends and which will lead to suggestions how rating systems should be more encompassing and be inline with practical implementation. \\xc2\\xa9 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\"\\n\"Saucier D.S., Gilley C.T., McGee R.O., Parnell Jr. C.B., Capareda S.\",\"Benefits of onsite gasification of cotton gin trash for power production at cotton gins\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-81255158512&partnerID=40&md5=a8aab4278a44ff4c4af3b040a54dccab\",\"The decision by the EPA to regulate green house gases (GHG) and to significantly reduce GHG emissions from coal fired power plants (CFPP), will likely result in reduced availability of electricity in the near future. The technology exists to produce electricity from power plants fueled with cotton gin trash (CGT). The utilization of excess cotton biomass (CGT) as the fuel to produce useable energy with a gasification-based conversion technology is not new. Cotton gins will realize immediate benefits from the use of CGT to fuel on-site power plants through gasification. Gins will become a source of reliable electricity and heat energy during the ginning season and beyond. The expense of CGT disposal will be eliminated and replaced with additional revenue streams from the gasification process. Biochar produced as a byproduct of gasification may be sold as a commodity or value-added product. Excess electricity produced at the gin can be sold back to the grid to generate additional revenue. Renewable energy benefits may result in additional savings and benefits. Credits for green energy and carbon sequestration may also contribute to the cotton gin\\'s revenue stream.\"\\n\"Whitmore J., Schulze P.\",\"Artificial light in the work environment: A balanced perspective for energy efficiency and support for immunological health\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80053084114&doi=10.18848%2f1832-2077%2fcgp%2fv07i03%2f54937&partnerID=40&md5=27266264125c99bfc2b0f7c7a914db63\",\"Utilization of lighting in buildings is an evolving topic of research. The definition of sustainable design now includes a concern for health as affected by indoor environmental quality. The U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), through the voluntary LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) credits allow 17 credits related to indoor environmental quality for Commercial Interiors (Version v3, 2009). In 2006, the Center for Building Performance and Diagnostic (CBPD) at Carnegie Mellon University took initiatives to expand the definition given by earlier LEED criteria. Among the seven CBPD Principles for the design of sustainable built environments, they recommened merging the \"\"natural minimum resource conditioning solutions of the past (daylight, solar, heat and natural ventilation) with the innovative technologies of the present.\"\" This paper will look at the quality of artificial light and its role in the support of human health. Interdisciplinary research in the fields of neurobiology, choronobiology, photobiology and epigenetics are linked to demonstrate the critical nature of artificial lighting in our indoor environment. Although lighting decisions have more recently been driven by concerns about energy consumption, the thesis presented here is that the field of interior design needs to understand how to balance the typical concerns of energy conservation of the planet with concern for optimizing human functioning and health. Energy consumption is important; however, if we make all our new lighting directives based solely on energy efficiency, we will again be victims of our shortsightedness. Our knowledge of the interrelatedness of light and human physiology can be used to add another directive to the seven principles of CPBD, and to bring balance to our priorities in lighting and design. \\xc2\\xa9 Common Ground, Julie Whitmore, Pamela Schulze, All Rights Reserved.\"\\n\"Lamb J., Leach K.\",\"The credit crisis: A golden opportunity to extend localisation and stimulate genuinely sustainable local economic development\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80052985090&doi=10.1504%2fIJGE.2011.042558&partnerID=40&md5=71fef083d089af7d5d6047b81019a0fb\",\"The credit crisis and associated economic instability continues to cause great anxiety; and even after two years there appears little appetite to talk in terms of the \\'green shoots of recovery\\' (Woodcock, 2009; Nelson, 2011).

Our data show that, although the potential is high, the insufficient supply of irrigation water, excessively expensive chemical fertilizer, and moderately costly labor hinder the scheme from achieving that potential. First of all, an improvement in irrigation is crucial as it increases yield not only directly but also indirectly through its complementary relationship to chemical fertilizer. We also find that an improvement in credit access is important as it can increase the application of chemical fertilizer and labor by making the acquisition of these expensive inputs through markets possible. The unavailability of hired and exchange labor during peak seasons is another constraint to the intensive use of labor. The introduction of rice varieties with a shorter maturity duration would relax the timing of transplanting and thus spread out the peak seasons\\' labor demand. \\xc2\\xa9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.\"\\n\"Despins C., Labeau F., Le Ngoc T., Labelle R., Cheriet M., Thibeault C., Gagnon F., Leon-Garcia A., Cherkaoui O., St. Arnaud B., McNeill J., Lemieux Y., Lemay M.\",\"Leveraging green communications for carbon emission reductions: Techniques, testbeds, and emerging carbon footprint standards\",2011,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80051708248&doi=10.1109%2fMCOM.2011.5978422&partnerID=40&md5=1b93ec51ee8cdbd40dfa74bee6b84e8c\",\"Green communication systems and, in broader terms, green information and communications technologies have the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.

Specifically, the co-firing of biomass with coal could be regarded as a common feature of any new build power plant if a sustainable supply of biomass fuel is readily accessible. Currently, there is an on-going discussion on what could be the pros and cons of incorporating CO2 capture and storage (CCS) to any type of biomass-fired power plant. The discussion has primarily centred on how to consider the CO2 emitted from biomass-fired power plants, if it is counted as \"\"CO2 neutral\"\" and if stored, whether it could be considered as a \"\"negative\"\" CO2 emission. One of the main questions addressed in this study was \"\"What should be the CO2 emission cost that would make CCS an attractive option to be incorporated into a biomass fired power plant assuming that the stored CO2 from a biomass fired power plant could generate an additional revenue as CO2 credit\"\" The study, carried out by Foster Wheeler for the IEA Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme (IEA GHG), aimed to address these questions, and investigated and evaluated the different options and techno-economic performance of a biomass-fired power plant or a coal power plant co-fired with biomass, based on current state-of the art boiler and steam generation equipment incorporating post-combustion CO2 capture based on MEA solvent. Specifically, the study evaluated the following cases comparing the performance and techno-economics of the power plants with and without CO2 capture. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Case 1: nominal 500 MWe (net) co-firing of biomass and coal in pulverised fuel (PF) power plant. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Case 2: nominal 500 MWe (net) co-firing of biomass and coal in CFB power plant. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Case 3: nominal 250 MWe (net) circulating fluidized bed standalone biomass power plant. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Case 4: nominal 75 MWe (net) bubbling fluidized bed standalone biomass power plant.

We study the relative efficacy of state sales tax waivers, income tax credits, and non-tax incentives and find that the type of tax incentive offered is as important as the generosity of the incentive. Conditional on value, sales tax waivers are associated with more than a ten-fold increase in hybrid sales relative to income tax credits. In addition, we examine how adoption varies with fuel prices. Rising gasoline prices are associated with greater hybrid vehicle sales, but this effect operates almost entirely through high fuel-economy vehicles. By comparing consumer response to sales tax waivers and estimated future fuel savings, we estimate an implicit discount rate of 14.6% on future fuel savings. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 Elsevier Inc.\"\\n\"Muench S.T., Anderson J., Bevan T.\",\"Greenroads: A sustainability rating system for roadways\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78651541736&partnerID=40&md5=48f252e8e743d115d608a4065119ba4c\",\"Greenroads (www.greenroads.us) is a proposed standard for quantifying sustainable practices associated with the design and construction of roadways. It is a performance metric that awards points for approved sustainable choices/practices and can be used to certify roadway projects based on the achievement of a list of project requirements and the total points earned. Such a standard can (1) allow informed sustainability decisions, (2) provide a quantitative means of sustainability assessment, (3) stimulate improvement and innovation in roadway sustainability, and (4) provide baseline sustainability standards. This paper describes Greenroads version 1.0, which consists of 11 Project Requirements, 37 Voluntary Credits (for a total of 108 points) and a Custom Credits section. Specific attention is paid to (1) how the system works, (2) the development cycle in the coming years, and (3) how sustainable concrete pavement solutions fit into the performance metric. Specifically, the direct use of concrete and concrete contractors can earn up to 42 Voluntary Credit points available (39% of the total). Specific concrete-related Greenroads work in the future includes investigation of potential Voluntary Credits covering design-for-deconstruction, ENERGY STAR label cement plants and recognizing recycled content in Portland cement manufacturing processes. \\xc2\\xa9 Chinese Society of Pavement Engineering.\"\\n\"Zhang J.\",\"E-money: Application, challenge and development\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78649676143&doi=10.1109%2fICEE.2010.993&partnerID=40&md5=5ed25cdb79f9403e52fbb67a50844967\",\"E-money is a combing product of modern electron technology and money development.

After consultations failed to resolve their concerns, both countries (again acting independently) requested the establishment of a WTO panel to rule on their complaints. The WTO\\'s Dispute Settlement Body, on December 17, 2007, established a single panel to consider both cases. In late April 2008, Brazil and Canada informally agreed to postpone proceeding with their joint World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement case challenging certain U.S. agricultural subsidies. At the time of the postponement, the three parties involved in the dispute had been unable to agree on panel membership. The postponement was thought to be provisional based on success in achieving further disciplines on domestic support in the current Doha Round of WTO trade negotiations. However, the Doha Round negotiations failed to complete an agreement in 2009. As of early 2010 there are no prospects for revival of Doha Round negotiations. Nor have Brazil and Canada given any indication that they will revive their pursuit of their joint case. It is not clear how long the postponement will persist. If resumed, the first order of business will be the formation of a panel. The joint case combines two separate but similar cases: DS357, brought by Canada, and DS365, brought by Brazil. Both cases make two charges against U.S. farm programs-first, that the United States has exceeded its annual WTO commitment levels for total aggregate measurement of support (AMS) for agriculture in each of the years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2005, and second, that the U.S. export credit guarantee program for agricultural commodities operates as a WTO-illegal export subsidy. Both charges stem, in large part, from a previous negative ruling against U.S. farm programs in a case (DS267) brought by Brazil against the U.S. cotton program. In that case, a WTO panel ruled (the ruling subsequently was upheld by a WTO Appellate Body), first, that direct payments made under U.S. farm programs do not qualify for green box exemption status because of a restriction prohibiting the planting of fruits, vegetables, or wild rice on payment acres; and second, that the U.S. export credit guarantee program operates as a prohibited export subsidy program because the financial benefits returned by these programs failed to cover their long-run operating costs. As a result of the ruling, U.S. export credit guarantees became subject to previously scheduled export subsidy commitments. For more information, see CRS Report RL32571, Brazil\\'s WTO Case Against the U.S. Cotton Program, by Randy Schnepf. Canada and Brazil claim that, since they fail to qualify for inclusion in the green box, U.S. direct payments should be added to its AMS when calculating total domestic support. In addition, they also charge that the United States has improperly notified several of its farm support programs as exempt from the AMS limit, while several other programs were improperly excluded from U.S. notifications. Canada and Brazil claim that when all of the outlays from these allegedly misnotified programs are included, then the U.S. AMS total exceeds its WTO commitment level. Should a panel be formed and eventually rule on this case, any changes in U.S. farm policy needed to comply with a WTO ruling against the United States would likely involve action by Congress to produce new legislation.This chapter provides background and details, as well as the current status of the two WTO dispute settlement cases. In addition, it discusses the role of Congress in responding to developments. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

It is necessary to create public awareness of multiple benefits and environmental services provided by the forests and thereby encourage people\\'s participation in the conservation, protection, and management of forests. Joint Forest Management (JFM) is an approach for sharing of products, responsibilities, control, and decision-making authority over forest land between Forest Departments and local user groups based on a formal agreement. Carbon credit can be generated through carbon sequestration by plantation like reforestation and afforestation project, and this credit can be distributed to the poor people in and around the forest area through different schemes such as employment-generation, education, child welfare, small-scale cottage industries, biogas generation, etc. A major part of the earned amount by the carbon credit can be distributed to the forest neighbors who are directly dependent on forest and forest produce for their livelihood. This will give them a fresh look to the forest protection from the forestdegradation or illegal felling. Green belt or afforestation is a statutory condition for any development activities where carbon sequestration has not been considered in the concept of green belt or afforestation. This could be recommended to include and select more effective carbon sequestrated plant species in the design of green belt or afforestation for effective mitigation of environmental pollution along with reducing of regional climatic temperature for the sustainable development of any project. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.\"\\n\"Roy K.P.\",\"Green rating systems and classroom acoustic design\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84869098425&partnerID=40&md5=8fa0359515b5d00e5dd808c274506f5f\",\"With our increasing sensitivity to the impact of school buildings on the environment worldwide, we have moved towards goals of sustainability and green design. Early implications of \\'green design\\' strategies indicated that design decisions should not be made solely on the basis of sustainability and energy conservation.

Survey results from occupant satisfaction surveys such as by the Center for the Built Environment (CBE) from the University of California at Berkeley initially showed that \\'green\\' buildings (LEED\\xc2\\xae rated) generally did not fare as well as traditional buildings relative to occupant satisfaction with acoustics performance. More recently, the various green rating systems used around the world address acoustics within the frame work of the ratings either as prerequisites, or for enhanced credit points. School buildings are designed and built specifically for the purpose of educating students, where teachers teach and students learn primarily on the basis of verbal and visual teaching cues - obviously a primary goal must be acoustic performance. The acoustic design objective for classrooms must involve designing for speech clarity with architecture, and protecting the speech clarity by ensuring good mechanical system design to limit the background noise.

Their projects are typically funded through a combination of equity provided by the developer and investors and short- and long-term debt provided by lenders. Despite the political appeal of renewable energy projects and the popular perception that massive amounts of funding are readily available at the turn of a tap, developers face increased difficulty in the current economic environment in obtaining both equity and debt financing for projects. Equity participants, lenders, and other project participants are applying more stringent evaluations of the operations, finances, and credit of the developer. Additionally, because the cooling of the economy has slowed energy demand, utilities not subject to mandatory standards are less eager to pay a premium for green power. It is now more important than ever for developers to explore every avenue of project funding to ensure a successful, viable project.

That is why the efficiency concept has to be present at all levels of industrial activities. Nowadays, some purchasing decisions are still driven predominately by the purchase price. This market segment is not specification driven and its focus is not on total cost of ownership (TOC). Purchase prices represent up to 5 % to 20 % of the TOC, function of equipments values (low = LVE or high = HVE). Predominant component of the TOC is the energy cost that is directly influenced by the efficiency of the conversion process. Although with more efficient equipments energy savings might be considered during purchase decision, the every growing importance on the environment of \"\"Green House Gas\"\" (GHG) emissions is still not a major factor when selecting such equipments. Often more traditional equipment is purchased at the expense of new innovative technologies that in addition to providing energy savings can also be used as a tool for trading Carbon Credits in the financial marketplace. The paper presents essentials of converter types (single and complex) and basics of the Global Efficiency (GEff) concept that has been promoted over the last few years in South African industries [1]. GEff is proven as a useful tool used on price-efficiency decisions. Theoretical and technical aspects of this concept were substantiated with case studies. This part of the paper describes how GEff concept was used on price - efficiency decisions when single input (direct) converters (considered as low value equipments) have been replaced.

The metal casting industry annually uses an estimated 100 million tons of foundry sand for production. Over time, foundry sands physically degrade until they are no longer suitable for molds. Consequently, 9 to 10 million tons of sand is discarded each year. However, the discarded foundry sands have remarkably consistent composition and are generally considered a higher quality material than typical bank run or natural sands used in construction. Currently, an estimated 28% of discarded foundry sand is reused, primarily in construction-related applications, while the remaining sand is disposed of in landfills (American Foundry Society 2007). Recycling of foundry sand can save energy, reduce the need to mine virgin materials, and may reduce costs for both producers and end users. Use of foundry sand as a fine aggregate in construction applications offers project managers the ability to enhance green sustainable construction by reducing their carbon footprint, while also qualifying for LEED credits. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently estimated that at the current recycling level 20,000 tons of CO2 emissions are prevented while 200 billion BTUs of energy are saved (US EPA 2008). Support for increased reuse of foundry sand has brought together the U.S. EPA, the Federal Highway Administration, the U. S. Department of Agriculture, the Recycled Materials Resource Center (RMRC), state environmental agencies, the foundry industry and end users to develop the tools and resources needed to increase foundry sand recycling to 50% by 2015. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the engineering and construction properties of foundry sand for use in Portland cement concrete, hot mix asphalt, road subbase layers, embankments, and flowable fill. Recent studies addressing environmental concerns of using foundry sand as a construction material are reviewed. With the goal of advancing use of foundry sand in construction application, references to resources and tools, such as web-based training and a foundry locator map module, are made available. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 ASCE.\"\\n\"Lee J., Edil T.B., Benson C.H., Tinjum J.M.\",\"Use of BE2ST in-highways for green highway construction rating in Wisconsin\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79251470407&partnerID=40&md5=dc49c2d12268bfdd628a361044d74d9d\",\"This paper describes a green highway construction rating system named Building Environmentally and Economically Sustainable Transportation Infrastructure-Highways (BE2ST in-Highways). BE2ST in-Highways employs life cycle analysis techniques to provide a quantitative assessment of the impacts associated with a highway construction project. Energy and water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, service life, and life cycle cost are evaluated in a quantitative framework that can be used to compare alternative construction strategies from a holistic perspective. The methodology is grounded in quantitative metrics rather than an arbitrary point system so that a transparent linkage exists between the project rating and the sustainable practices employed in design and construction. This transparency reduces the potential for \\'gaming\\' of the rating system. Application of the BE2ST in-Highways system to a project in Wisconsin is described. Results of the application indicate that using recycled materials in a pavement can result in reductions in global warming potential (32%), energy consumption (28%), water consumption (29%), and hazardous waste generation (25%) as compared to the reference design using conventional materials, while also extending the service life of the pavement. In addition, using recycled materials in a pavement can result in a life cycle cost savings of 23%. Because of this environmental and economical outperformance of the alternative design using recycled materials compared to the reference design using conventional materials, the maximum total credit (i.e., 12 points) is granted to the project. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 ASCE.\"\\n\"Das D., Sengupta P.P.\",\"Social cost of environmental pollution & application of counter measures through clean development mechanism with the effect of Additionality & Baseline - In the context of developing countries\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78651471220&doi=10.1109%2fICEMT.2010.5657617&partnerID=40&md5=20d0f634daa46df64e8a0c4d53f6c107\",\"The developing countries are also allowed by the Kyoto Protocol to meet their GHG emissions, so that they may be benefited from CDM projects to promote sustainable development.

However, in every great civilisation the pleasures and sustaining powers of the garden have extended into the public domain to the benefit of its citizens and to civilised life. In the late 19th and 20th centuries the healing powers of green landscape were increasingly recognised. By the late 20th century the value of landscape in anchoring people in time and place and in developing a sense of community also became apparent. In 2009, therefore, urban horticulture encompasses at least seven inter-related aspects: a revival in exciting public horticulture from elaborate bedding schemes to wildflower meadows; the convergence of horticulture and applied ecology in the creation of new public landscapes; awareness of \\'ecosystem services\\' aspect of green space for flood control, environmental amelioration and biodiversity; benefits to human health; the use of \\'gardening\\' as a catalyst for social cohesion; environmental education to give children a sound understanding of their place in nature; appreciation of the economic benefits of green space rather than the traditional focus on its costs. There are six key factors which will shape urban horticulture in the 21st century and which will determine its contribution to civilized life: climate change; decreasing oil supplies; population growth; the countervailing attractions of town and country; social order or disorder; global finance. The black cloud of the credit crunch could have a silver lining if the reassessment of our true wealth becomes the butterfly wing redirecting our society into a more sustainable way of life in which urban horticulture will have a key role to play.\"\\n\"Kim H.-J., Lee H.-S., Lee S.-W., Jung D.-H., Moon D.-S.\",\"Mitigation of environmental impact of power-plant discharge by use of ocean thermal energy conversion system\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78349241133&doi=10.1109%2fOCEANSSYD.2010.5603973&partnerID=40&md5=28c148c937efdfacbbe3f752dc20ca58\",\"This study aims to evaluate the mitigation method of environmental impact of power-plant discharges by reducing the temperature difference between effluent and coastal water. To minimize excessive thermal pollution which could cause serious socio-economic problems, Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) system can be applied to control the resultant temperature of combined discharge as well as to produce electricity by reusing the warm discharge from power-plant as a heat source for OTEC. Adaptability analysis of closed cycle OTEC was examined to 350MW fossil fuel power plant. The results show that combined system could mitigate the thermal discharge effectively if suitable size of OTEC is connected with the power-plant. Furthermore, this method gives us marine forest to absorb carbon dioxide which may be altered to green house gas emission credit as well as clean electric power. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 IEEE.\"\\n\"Arava R., Bagchi D., Suresh P., Narahari Y., Subrahmanya S.V.\",\"Optimal allocation of carbon credits to emitting agents in a carbon economy\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78149455906&doi=10.1109%2fCOASE.2010.5584129&partnerID=40&md5=ca08a1ee54457f806789276c0a7afa96\",\"Reduction of carbon emissions is of paramount importance in the context of global warming. Countries and global companies are now engaged in understanding systematic ways of achieving well defined emission targets. In fact, carbon credits have become significant and strategic instruments of finance for countries and global companies. In this paper, we formulate and suggest a solution to the carbon allocation problem, which involves determining a cost minimizing allocation of carbon credits among different emitting agents. We address this challenge in the context of a global company which is faced with the challenge of determining an allocation of carbon credit caps among its divisions in a cost effective way. The problem is formulated as a reverse auction problem where the company plays the role of a buyer or carbon planning authority and the different divisions within the company are the emitting agents that specify cost curves for carbon credit reductions. Two natural variants of the problem: (a) with unlimited budget and (b) with limited budget are considered. Suitable assumptions are made on the cost curves and in each of the two cases we show that the resulting problem formulation is a knapsack problem that can be solved optimally using a greedy heuristic. The solution of the allocation problem provides critical decision support to global companies engaged seriously in green programs. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 IEEE.\"\\n\"Groot W.J., Bor\\xc3\\xa9n T.\",\"Life cycle assessment of the manufacture of lactide and PLA biopolymers from sugarcane in Thailand\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78149409950&doi=10.1007%2fs11367-010-0225-y&partnerID=40&md5=18f67797e3e049cf50157993d180984a\",\"Background: l-lactide is the monomer for the polymer poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA). PLLA can be made from renewable resources, and is used in an increasing amount of applications. The biopolymer PLLA is one type of polymer of the family of polylactic acids (PLAs). Purac produces l-lactide and d-lactide, and supports partners with know-how to produce their own PLA from lactide. This life cycle assessment (LCA) study supporting market development presents the eco-profile of lactides and PLA biopolymers. Method: An LCA was carried out for l-lactide, d-lactide, PLLA, and two PLLA/PDLA blends made from cane sugar in Thailand, and were compared with that of fossil-based polymers. The LCA complies with ISO standards, and is a cradle-to-gate analysis including sugarcane cultivation, sugarcane milling, auxiliary chemicals production, transport, and production of lactide and PLAs. In the analysis, process data were taken from the designs of full-scale plants for the production of lactic acid, lactides, and PLA. The data were combined with ecoprofiles of chemicals and utilities and recalculated to the following environmental impacts: primary renewable and non-renewable energy, non-renewable abiotic resource usage, farm land use, global warming, acidification, photochemical ozone creation, human toxicity, and eutrophication. Results and discussion: On a weight-by-weight basis, PLLA results in significantly lower emissions of greenhouse gasses, and less use of material resources and non-renewable energy, compared to fossil-based polymers. With the present calculations, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) in l-lactide production is 300-600 kg CO2 eq./tonne and for PLLA 500-800 kg CO2 eq./tonne. The range indicates the sensitivity of the GWP to the energy credit for electricity production from bagasse in the sugar mill. The GWP of PLLA/PDLA blends with increased heat resistance is also lower compared to fossil based polymers with similar durable character. Being based on an agricultural system the biobased PLA gives rise to higher contributions to acidification, photochemical ozone creation, eutrophication, and farm land use compared to the fossil polymers. Conclusions: The application spectrum of PLAs is expanding, and there are opportunities to replace various fossil-based polymers. This facilitates climate change mitigation and reduces dependence on fossil and scarce resources while promoting the use of local and renewable resources. It is evident that in emerging green economies agricultural technology will form an integral part in the changeover towards a more sustainable industry and society. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 Springer-Verlag.\"\\n\"Dickens K.\",\"Data center star search\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78349239241&partnerID=40&md5=2d34d31599122b120eaf13310409ef00\",\"The impact of the ASHRAE 90.1 standard and the EPA ENERGY STAR Program Management Office in the design of a data center is discussed.

The general perception is that attempting to achieve sustainability will increase the capital cost of construction and can delay the schedule. In recent years, societal pressure and government incentives as well as practitioners knowledge and acknowledgement, have led many construction projects to pursue sustainability credits. In 2002, Canada Green Building Council (CaGBC) adopted the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standard as a tool to evaluate the sustainability of construction projects. The main objective of this research is to generate a better understanding of LEED professionals\\' perception of the impact of achieving LEED credits on projects parameters such as cost, schedule and future value. A survey was conducted to clarify their position towards the impact of each of the 69 points in the early version of LEED-New Construction on project factors. The survey targets factors in its three phases - prior to construction, during construction and post construction. The results can assist in improving the evaluating systems and developing sustainability design tools in the future.

All involved aspire to make these changes in an economically efficient manner. This article provides an after tax economic model to help determine pricing (fares), the level of subsidies, the impact of carbon credits, and financial leverage options. Most approaches to compare new technologies use before tax analyses like societal life cycle costs. Most industry analyses use an after tax analysis approach. This article describes and compares both techniques. To illustrate the proposed after tax analysis transportation model, a carbon free bus system fueled by hydrogen is used with data extracted from published sources. Major conclusions are that a carbon credit (from Cap & Trade or carbon tax) provides some economic gain, but does not meet the economic criteria established. Borrowing funds (e.g., using financial leverage) for the capital costs significantly increases the rate of return and could attract investors; however, increased borrowing increases the financial risk and this risk needs to be moderated via risk mitigation strategies (default insurance, etc.). Other financing options need to be explored. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 by the American Society for Engineering Management.\"\\n\"Bilek A.\",\"Accelerating deployment of biogas production and utilization\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77957928081&partnerID=40&md5=ec42f6396b61bd4a5b466629d221b991\",\"The Great Plains Institute (GPI), in its report titled \\'Spotlight on biogas: policies for utilization and deployment in the Midwest\\', has suggested various public policy options for a continued growth of the biogas industry in the Midwest.

The Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) was used to model runoff at five locations across the U.S. for 10 years, with varying degrees of urbanization represented by a range of curve numbers. Based on natural soil type and vegetative cover, a target curve number was assigned to each location. A watershed\\'s runoff flow volume and rates were calculated for each curve number and the change in flow volumes were then calculated relative to the target curve number. The percent decrease was then assigned a point value which a developer could potentially use for credit, similar to the U.S. Green Building Council\\'s LEED\\xc2\\xae program.

The maximum size of the aggregate in proportion of 9.5 mm to 4.75 mm particle in the coarse aggregate of CCW on the properties of the pervious cement concrete is investigated. Typically pervious concrete has little to no fine aggregate and has just enough cementitious paste to coat the coarse aggregate particles while preserving the interconnectivity of the voids. The work includes, type and volume of CCW from various sources in the city of Bangalore; testing and evaluating quality of aggregate made from CCW and evaluating effect of replacement of natural aggregate by recycled aggregate in medium- grade pervious cement concrete. High strength cement allows pervious cement concrete to be produced with water cementitious materials ratios in the range of 0.30 to 0.34. This relatively high level of water reduction and efficient cement dispersion maximizes the strength potential of pervious concrete mixes using CCW. The 28-day compressive strength of CCW used pervious cement concrete was about 3% to 11 % lower than that of the pervious cement concrete made of regular coarse aggregate. The decrease in strength can be compensated for by normal mixture adjustments to achieve the desired strength control. The infiltration rate of pervious cement concrete made of CCW fall in the range of 70 to 680 liters per minute per square meter.

The analyses covered all key farming systems and agro-climates of Africa in 11 countries in which data were collected from over 10,000 farm household surveys. Results provided evidence that African agriculture and the welfare of its rural population are vulnerable to CC. The highest risk of future CC damages is associated with specialised crop and livestock farming (mono systems) particularly under dryland conditions in arid and semi-arid regions. This indicates how difficult it is to achieve an African green revolution under the current high reliance on dryland systems (more than 95% of the land) given predicted harsh future climates (warmer and dryer projections) for most of the dryland areas in Africa. It will require substantial public and private investments in expanding irrigation and development of crop var-ieties and animal breeds that are tolerant to heat, water and low fertility stres-ses, and in building roads and marketing infrastructures that will improve access to critical inputs (e.g., fertiliser) and output trade. This essentially requires mainstreaming climate sensitivity as an integral component of all agricultural and broader economic development planning and policy design. Although the expected damages are large, many farming systems and communities in Africa face serious limiting conditions which reduce their ability to adapt and hence increase their vulnerability. Among the key factors found to constrain African farmers\\' ability to adopt effective adaptation measures are poor access to information, capital, technology and markets. Policies aimed at promoting farm-level adaptation need to emphasise the critical role of farmers\\' education; provision of improved climate, production and market information and the means to implement adaptations through affordable credit facilities. Other needed public interventions to help promote adaptation measures and reduce vulnerability include insurance against climate risks to farmers and provision of safety nets. \\xc2\\xa9 The author 2010.

This study presents a concept of rival private governance where multiple initiatives compete for rule-setting authority. Specifically, we argue that heterogeneous actors organize in network form to establish legitimacy of new sustainability governance fields. In an effort to preempt threats from these new fields of governance, nonparticipating actors create rival private governance networks and compete based on each network\\'s ability to access unique relational assets from participants. Based on the cases of carbon off-set standards, green building rating systems and sustainable forestry certifications, we suggest that this competitive market vetting results in pressures toward the convergence of governance rules over time, but not a single winning set of rules. Our findings illustrate that multiple and competing networks can provide innovative, legitimate and dynamically evolving governance of sustainability, while presenting new challenges for public and private sector actors. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.\"\\n\"DeBusk K.M., Hunt W.F.\",\"Alternative site-assessment hydrologic metrics for urban development\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954915389&doi=10.1061%2f41099%28367%2958&partnerID=40&md5=96067527e09c65d9304778c625302de3\",\"While LID techniques are becoming more commonplace across the United States, there is no universally-accepted method for evaluating how well a site adheres to LID principles; namely, how closely the post-development hydrology mimics predevelopment (or target) hydrology. As part of the Sustainable Sites Initiative\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 (www.sustainablesites.org) a method was developed to assess the pre- and post-development hydrology of a site and provide a means for a currently built upon site (a greyfield) to receive credit for partial restoration of hydrology. The Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) was used to model runoff at five locations across the U.S. for 10 years, with varying degrees of urbanization represented by a range of curve numbers. Based on natural soil type and vegetative cover, a target curve number was assigned to each location. A watershed\\'s runoff flow volume and rates were calculated for each curve number and the change in flow volumes were then calculated relative to the target curve number. The percent decrease was then assigned a point value which a developer could potentially use for credit, similar to the U.S. Green Building Council\\'s LEED\\xc2\\xae program. Graphical representations of hydrologic conditions and corresponding point values were developed. This method provides developers and regulators with a tangible, numeric goal for post-development hydrology when retrofitting developed sites while allowing flexibility in how that goal is achieved. The analysis of additional locations could provide the means for this approach to become the primary method across the country to evaluate a site\\'s adherence to LID hydrologic principles. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 ASCE.\"\\n\"Prickett L., Bicknell J.\",\"LID, LEED and alternative rating systems - Integrating low impact development techniques with green building design\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954913799&doi=10.1061%2f41099%28367%2970&partnerID=40&md5=47e445198a7131a1b99e1d6a1edd6c04\",\"The demand for developments that achieve green rating criteria continues to be strong despite the weakened economy. Many municipalities throughout the U.S. are adopting green development ordinances or policies with various environmental goals, often with an emphasis on addressing global climate change. At the same time, environmental advocates and state and federal stormwater regulators are increasingly emphasizing low impact development (LID) design techniques to reduce long-term water quality impacts from new development and significant redevelopment projects, replenish groundwater resources, and provide for rainwater capture and reuse. This paper explores opportunities for harnessing some of the momentum of the green building movement to further the implementation of LID strategies in new development and redevelopment projects. We examine the extent to which LID designs can earn green building credits under Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating systems for new construction (LEED-NC) and neighborhood development (LEED-ND), as well as alternative rating systems such as the Sustainable Sites Initiative (led by the American Society of Landscape Architects, Ladybird Johnson Wildflower Center, and U.S. Botanic Society), and GreenPoint Rated (a program of Build It Green, a California non-profit organization). The paper features the results of a comparison of green building criteria in LEED and alternative rating systems with LID techniques that may earn green development credits. Gaps in credit availability for specific LID techniques are identified, along with opportunities to further integrate the LID approach and green building initiatives. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 ASCE.\"\\n\"Lee M., Krishnakumar A.S., Krishnan P., Singh N., Yajnik S.\",\"Supporting soft real-time tasks in the Xen hypervisor\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79959886151&doi=10.1145%2f1837854.1736012&partnerID=40&md5=eddb7eb4eee08818392c5af7945679e9\",\"Virtualization technology enables server consolidation and has given an impetus to low-cost green data centers. However, current hypervisors do not provide adequate support for real-time applications, and this has limited the adoption of virtualization in some domains. Soft real-time applications, such as media-based ones, are impeded by components of virtualization including lowperformance virtualization I/O, increased scheduling latency, and shared-cache contention. The virtual machine scheduler is central to all these issues. The goal in this paper is to adapt the virtual machine scheduler to be more soft-real-time friendly. We improve two aspects of the VMM scheduler - managing scheduling latency as a first-class resource and managing shared caches. We use enterprise IP telephony as an illustrative soft realtime workload and design a scheduler S that incorporates the knowledge of soft real-time applications in all aspects of the scheduler to support responsiveness. For this we first define a laxity value that can be interpreted as the target scheduling latency that the workload desires. The load balancer is also designed to minimize the latency for real-time tasks. For cache management, we take cache-affinity into account for real time tasks and load-balance accordingly to prevent cache thrashing. We measured cache misses and demonstrated that cache management is essential for soft real time tasks. Although our scheduler S employs a different design philosophy, interestingly enough it can be implemented with simple modifications to the Xen hypervisor\\'s credit scheduler. Our experiments demonstrate that the Xen scheduler with our modifications can support soft real-time guests well, without penalizing non-real-time domains. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 ACM.\"\\n[No author name available],\"Research shows access to finance is \\'worsening\\'\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78651310863&partnerID=40&md5=8114f8b59c862a96920808e56e54408d\",\"New research from the Forum of Private Business shows that access to finance is worsening for small companies.

Findings: It was found that the indigenous palm candy production gave better livelihood for the Nadar community whose prime occupation is harvesting of palm products. Even though the community was in the lowest ebb of the society, proper enterprise capacity building, value addition to palm product like palm candy, marketing and access to credit have paved way for the development of the community. The institutions promoted by Palmyrah Workers Development Society catered to the enterprise intervention of the community thereby increasing the income level of the families. Even though globalization is a threat for rural artisan products, the concept of green and fair trade is providing avenues for rural enterprise. Research limitations/implications: The study was restricted within a particular community and within a given geographical area.

Besides, the results from this model are used to compare the economic effectiveness of each mechanism in increasing the profitability of these projects. We focus on three renewable energy support mechanisms: governmental grants, feed in tariffs (FiT) and renewable energy certificates (RECs). We also consider the effect of the carbon credits on the net present value of renewable projects and compare it with the other support mechanisms. The simulation results demonstrate that the feed in tariffs is the best mechanism to increase the profitability of solar PV systems and wind energy projects. Conversely, green certificate mechanism favors the most competitive technology as the hydropower. In addition, it is shown that the governmental grants and carbon credits are secondary support mechanisms compared to FiT and RECs. And, the carbon credits play a more important role than governmental grants as the energy output of the system increase. Finally, it can be concluded that the efficiency of the support mechanisms varies depending on stage of development of the renewable technologies that are implemented. \\xc2\\xa9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

By implementing green practices, for instance, by engaging in carbon credit programs, the health industry could benefit financially as well as reduce its negative impact on the health of our planet. Companies that reduce their carbon emissions by implementing energy-saving practices can sell their carbon credits to companies that emit more carbon than permissible by their legally binding commitment. These carbon profits can then be used for healthcare research or to provide healthcare to the underserved. Alternatively, the savings could be used for green purchasing and to implement other carbon-reducing activities. This report reviews the numerous possible options for the American health industry to become greener and lower its carbon footprint while at the same time becoming more time- and cost efficient.

A survey has indicated that PCs operate on as little as 110 W for thin clients to as much as 450 W for heavy-duty machines. Typical 1-U or 2-U servers with two or four CPUs will operate at between 250 and 450 W depending on configuration and load. Reducing the energy consumption of a 10,000-machine deployment of 150-W systems in California would save a lot of money due to high energy costs, but the carbon emissions impact would be equivalent to removing only 10 automobiles annually from the road. Besides the savings from reduced energy use, moderate deployments of 1,000 machines or more would reduce carbon emissions by hundreds of tons. Businesses that reduce IT power usage could reap secondary benefits from trading credits with a cap-and-trade system in place. With proper monitoring and tracking technology, businesses could generate thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars from the sales of carbon credits on the open market.\"\\n\"Li M.-T., Chu Y.-J.\",\"Research on index system of credit rating evaluation enterprises based on energy saving and emissions reduction\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77951210024&doi=10.3963%2fj.issn.1671-4431.2010.04.030&partnerID=40&md5=1a9b0f2cbc7cf14a8e0b52e85a29a756\",\"As the strategy of sustainable development has been recognized by the world, energy saving and emissions reduction becomes an important component and intrinsic need of the economic development model, which is characterized by low emissions, low consumption and low pollution.

Our key idea is based on the use of three broadband light sources in our data-nonintrusive photonics-based credit card verifier structure, where spectral components of the embossed hologram images are registered as red, green, and blue. In this case, nine distinguishable variables are generated for a feed-forward neural network (FFNN). In addition, we investigate the center of mass of the image histogram projected onto the x axis (Icolor), making our system more tolerant of the intensity fluctuation of the light source. We also reduce the unwanted signals on each hologram image by simply dividing the hologram image into three zones and then calculating their corresponding Icolor values for red, green, and blue bands.With our proposed concepts, we implement our field test prototype in which three broadband white light light-emitting diodes (LEDs), a two-dimensional digital color camera, and a four-layer FFNN are used. Based on 249 genuine credit cards and 258 counterfeit credit cards, we find that the average of differences in Icolor values between genuine and counterfeit credit cards is improved by 1.5 times and up to 13.7 times. In this case, we can effectively verify credit cards with a very low FRR of 0.79%. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 Optical Society of America.\"\\n\"Shah P.\",\"Awareness & preference towards carbon credits -an initiative to go for green\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050855573&doi=10.17010%2fpijom%2f2010%2fv3i2%2f61012&partnerID=40&md5=5dc38189714a10caf143cd0aa3cb656d\",[No abstract available]\\n\"Zhou Y., Tupper L., Chowdhury M., Klotz L.\",\"Green credits versus environmentally sustainable traffic operations: Comparison of contributions to energy and emissions reductions\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78651281209&doi=10.3141%2f2163-12&partnerID=40&md5=8a8a17f238c30f42e91e2c1e0a15e645\",\"Although society is facing a variety of environmental issues, including the depletion of energy resources, and has a much greater awareness of climate change and its serious related social impacts, transportation systems have been pushed to increasingly greater limits because of the dramatic growth in traffic demand. A case study was performed to compare the contributions of green construction credits and those of environmentally sustainable traffic operations to reducing energy use and emissions. The study measured the impacts of green credits by using the Carnegie Mellon University economic input-output life-cycle assessment model. These impacts were compared with those achieved through sustainable traffic operation strategies, consisting of a high-occupancy vehicle lane and access to public transit. The study shows that the energy and emissions reductions obtained by use of the traffic operation strategies eclipsed those obtained by use of the green credit measures in just 1 month of traffic operations. The carbon dioxide emissions created and the total energy consumed by only 1 month of traffic were three times greater and 30% more, respectively, than those obtained by repaving the same roadway. In addition to reducing emissions, environmentally sustainable traffic operations offer social sustainability benefits, such as reducing traffic delays and improving flow, which reduce the demand for transportation infrastructure and which can ultimately reduce the need for new roadway construction. Although both green credit measures and environmentally sustainable traffic operations are essential to true sustainability, the relative impacts of both traffic operations and construction credits should be considered when research and infrastructure investments are prioritized.\"\\n\"Maltzman R., Shirley D.\",\"Green project management\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055196358&doi=10.1201%2fEBK1439830017&partnerID=40&md5=fc84ac8ebc8f5552df8ff4e631ed531b\",\"Winner of PMI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2011 David I.

After consultations failed to resolve their concerns, both countries (again acting independently) requested the establishment of a WTO panel to rule on their complaints. The WTO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Dispute Settlement Body, on December 17, 2007, established a single panel to consider both cases. In late April 2008, Brazil and Canada informally agreed to postpone proceeding with their joint World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement case challenging certain U.S. agricultural subsidies. At the time of the postponement, the three parties involved in the dispute had been unable to agree on panel membership. The postponement was thought to be provisional based on success in achieving further disciplines on domestic support in the current Doha Round of WTO trade negotiations. However, the Doha Round negotiations failed to complete an agreement in 2009. As of early 2010 there are no prospects for revival of Doha Round negotiations. Nor have Brazil and Canada given any indication that they will revive their pursuit of their joint case. It is not clear how long the postponement will persist. If resumed, the first order of business will be the formation of a panel. The joint case combines two separate but similar cases: DS357, brought by Canada, and DS365, brought by Brazil. Both cases make two charges against U.S. farm programs-first, that the United States has exceeded its annual WTO commitment levels for total aggregate measurement of support (AMS) for agriculture in each of the years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2005, and second, that the U.S. export credit guarantee program for agricultural commodities operates as a WTO-illegal export subsidy. Both charges stem, in large part, from a previous negative ruling against U.S. farm programs in a case (DS267) brought by Brazil against the U.S. cotton program. In that case, a WTO panel ruled (the ruling subsequently was upheld by a WTO Appellate Body), first, that direct payments made under U.S. farm programs do not qualify for green box exemption status because of a restriction prohibiting the planting of fruits, vegetables, or wild rice on payment acres; and second, that the U.S. export credit guarantee program operates as a prohibited export subsidy program because the financial benefits returned by these programs failed to cover their long-run operating costs. As a result of the ruling, U.S. export credit guarantees became subject to previously scheduled export subsidy commitments. For more information, see CRS Report RL32571, Brazil\\xe2\\x80\\x99s WTO Case Against the U.S. Cotton Program, by Randy Schnepf. Canada and Brazil claim that, since they fail to qualify for inclusion in the green box, U.S. direct payments should be added to its AMS when calculating total domestic support. In addition, they also charge that the United States has improperly notified several of its farm support programs as exempt from the AMS limit, while several other programs were improperly excluded from U.S. notifications. Canada and Brazil claim that when all of the outlays from these allegedly misnotified programs are included, then the U.S. AMS total exceeds its WTO commitment level. Should a panel be formed and eventually rule on this case, any changes in U.S. farm policy needed to comply with a WTO ruling against the United States would likely involve action by Congress to produce new legislation.This report provides background and details, as well as the current status of the two WTO dispute settlement cases. In addition, it discusses the role of Congress in responding to developments. \\xc2\\xa9 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The maximum size of the aggregate and the proportion of the 9.5 mm to 4.75 mm particle in the coarse aggregate on the properties of the pervious cement concrete are investigated. Typically pervious concrete has little to no fine aggregate and has just enough cementitious paste to coat the coarse aggregate particles while preserving the interconnectivity of the voids. The work includes, type and volume of DCW from various sources in the city of Bangalore; testing and evaluating quality of aggregate made from DCW and evaluating effect of replacement of natural aggregate by recycled aggregate in medium- grade porous cement concrete. High strength cement allows pervious cement concrete to be produced with water cementitious materials ratios in the range of 0.30 to 0.34. This relatively high level of water reduction and efficient cement dispersion maximizes the strength potential of pervious concrete mixes using DCW. The 28-day compressive strength of DCW used pervious cement concrete was about 3% to 11 % lower than that of the pervious cement concrete made of regular coarse aggregate. The decrease in strength can be compensated for by normal mixture adjustments to achieve the desired strength control. The infiltration rate of pervious cement concrete made of DCW fall in the range of 70 to 680 liters per minute per square meter. Pervious cement concrete made of DCW can be used in parking areas, areas with light traffic, pedestrian walkways, nature trials and plazas. Pervious cement concrete made of DCW is used in building site design, it aids in the process of qualifying for LEED Green Building Rating system credits available for using recycled products.\"\\n\"Su J., Guo P.\",\"Environmental performance of enterprises in 2008\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84941563239&partnerID=40&md5=b406f4fd6be5e57898065857a47e2579\",\"This paper probes into the environmental performance of enterprises in 2008 from a variety of perspectives, such as industrial pollution, energy conservation, pollution discharge reduction, the disclosure of environmental information, green credit, the enterprise\\'s environmental strategy, and environmental public welfare.

This is a positive trend, since buildings require the use of vast amounts of resources and energy. They are, among other things, responsible for approximately 39% of CO2 emissions and 65% of waste outputs. Obviously, sustainable buildings require that their enclosure also be conceived and realized according to ecological principles. However, it appears that these green building enclosures are not always durable. Indeed, there are reports in North America of many green buildings having suffered major building enclosure failures after only a few years. This results in environmental, economical, and social impacts that can reduce or negate the positive impacts of those green buildings. The questions then become: What are the potential traps in green building design that can lead to such failures? And what can be done to avoid them? These questions are examined through examples of building enclosure failures in green buildings. These help identify potential pitfalls, which include \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Disregarding building science principles when designing a green building \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Designing green buildings with a configuration that is not adapted to their actual exposure conditions and context \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Using materials in the wrong places and/or for the wrong purposes because they meet certain ecological criteria A durability plan, such as required in the LEED\\xc2\\xae Canada Credit MRc8 \"\"Durable Building\"\" (based on CSA Standard S478-95 [R2001], \"\"Guideline on durability in buildings\"\"), can help minimize the risks of premature failure by addressing durability issues over the whole life cycle of the building. Although this does not guarantee that the building will be durable, it at least ensures that it has been designed and built to be durable. The basic elements of an actual durability plan are presented and discussed. In conclusion, some insights gained through the analysis of failures and the preparation of a durability plan are shared. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 ASHRAE.\"\\n\"Kevern J.T.\",\"Development and guidance of green concrete for leed\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 applications\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79251503292&doi=10.3992%2fjgb.5.4.111&partnerID=40&md5=1a02d51dba27bae870a8b71737e8846a\",\"As green building rating systems such as LEED\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 become more popular, the use of recycled materials in construction is increasing.

Global estimates are that grazing lands occupy \\xe2\\x88\\xbc3.6 billion ha and account for about one-fourth of potential carbon (C) sequestration in world soils. They remove the equivalent of \\xe2\\x88\\xbc20% of the carbon dioxide (CO2) released annually into the earth\\'s atmosphere from global deforestation and land-use changes. Atmospheric CO2 enters grazing lands soils through photosynthetic assimilation by green plants, subsequent cycling, and sequestration of some of that C as SOC to in turn contribute to the ability of grazing lands to provide societal (environmental and economic) benefits in every country where they exist. Environmental benefits provided include maintenance and well-being of immediate and surrounding soil and water resources, air quality, human and wildlife habitat, and esthetics. Grazing lands contribute to the economic well-being of those living on the land, to trade, and to exchange of goods and services derived from them at local, regional, or national levels. Rates of SOC sequestration vary with climate, soil, and management; examples and conditions selected from US literature illustrate the SOC sequestration that might be achieved. Public efforts, policy considerations, and research in the United States illustrate possible alternatives that impact grazing lands. Discussion of US policy issues related to SOC sequestration and global climate change reflect the importance attached to these topics and of pending legislative initiatives in the United States. Addressing primarily US policy does not lessen the importance of such issues in other countries, but allows an in-depth analysis of legislation, US Department of Agriculture program efforts, soil C credits in greenhouse gas markets, and research needs. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 Society for Range Management.\"\\n\"Conitzer V.\",\"Using a memory test to limit a user to one account\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77956120003&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-15237-5_5&partnerID=40&md5=e2022b6aa360870c7c006c8a27df53ef\",\"In many Web-based applications, there are incentives for a user to sign up for more than one account, under false names. By doing so, the user can send spam e-mail from an account (which will eventually cause the account to be shut down); distort online ratings by rating multiple times (in particular, she can inflate her own reputation ratings); indefinitely continue using a product with a free trial period; place shill bids on items that she is selling on an auction site; engage in false-name bidding in combinatorial auctions; etc. All of these behaviors are highly undesirable from the perspective of system performance. While CAPTCHAs can prevent a bot from automatically signing up for many accounts, they do not prevent a human from signing up for multiple accounts. It may appear that the only way to prevent the latter is to require the user to provide information that identifies her in the real world (such as a credit card or telephone number), but users are reluctant to give out such information. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach. We investigate whether it is possible to design an automated test that is easy to pass once, but difficult to pass a second time. Specifically, we design a memory test. In our test, items are randomly associated with colors (\"\"Cars are green.\"\"). The user first observes all of these associations, and is then asked to recall the colors of the items (\"\"Cars are...?\"\"). The items are the same across iterations of the test, but the colors are randomly redrawn each time (\"\"Cars are blue.\"\"). Therefore, a user who has taken the test before will occasionally accidentally respond with the association from the previous time that she took the test (\"\"Cars are...? Green!\"\"). If there is significant correlation between the user\\'s answers and the correct answers from a previous iteration of the test, then the system can decide that the user is probably the same, and refuse to grant another account. We present and analyze the results of a small study with human subjects. We also give a game-theoretic analysis. In the appendix, we propose an alternative test and present the results of a small study with human subjects for that test (however, the results for that test are quite negative). \\xc2\\xa9 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\"\\n\"Ogejo J.A., Li L.\",\"Enhancing biomethane production from flush dairy manure with turkey processing wastewater\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954032727&doi=10.1016%2fj.apenergy.2010.04.020&partnerID=40&md5=9b91aa4dff8fc993663051326958d010\",\"The objective of this study was to assess the quantity and quality of biogas produced by co-digesting flushed dairy manure (FDM) and turkey processing wastewater (TPW). An attached growth digester with working volume of 15 L and a 3 L head space was operated at a 5 d hydraulic retention time using five feed mixes containing 100, 67, 50, 33, and 0% FDM by volume. The biogas yield ranged from 0.072 to 0.8 m3 [g VS-1] and the methane content (quality) of the gas ranging from 56% to 70%. Both the quantity and quality of the biogas increased as the proportion of TPW in the feed increased. An energy balance for the digester based on a dairy farm with 150 animals, showed that augmenting FDM with TPW at 1:1 and 1:2 ratios, feeds C and D, respectively, produced biogas with net positive energy to all year round. The gas produced was enough to run a 50 kW generator to produce electricity for about 5.5 and 9 h for the 1:1 and 1:2 feed mixes. However, the economics were not favorable if the benefits of the digester are based only on the value electricity to be produced. Either, other possible revenues such as carbon credit, renewable energy credits, green tags for electricity, putting a value to the environmental benefits of AD should be considered or subsidies from grants or other incentives programs to make the system economically viable. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Using data from the year before and the ending year of the first phase, we did a case study in the Zhifanggou watershed on China\\'s Loess Plateau. We used a Data-Envelopment-Analysis based on Malmquist TFP index approach to find out the changes of TFP, the sources of TFP growth, and the determinant factors at a farm level. We found that 1) TFP has been greatly improved after the implementation of the program and 2) the sole source of TFP growth is technological growth. In contrast, the technical efficiency of farms under the improved technology has decreased; 3) farms with an unfavorable initial state benefited more after the introduction of the program; and 4) land terracing and access to credit contributed significantly to TFP growth and technological growth. Land terracing is positively related to technical efficiency change, too. Extension services are positively related to technological growth, while age is negatively related to technical efficiency change. We therefore suggest a focus on terracing slopes, improving access to credit and extension services.\"\\n\"Sovacool B.K.\",\"A comparative analysis of renewable electricity support mechanisms for Southeast Asia\",2010,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77949263667&doi=10.1016%2fj.energy.2009.12.030&partnerID=40&md5=17603f4472e8b6a1ef77f2f5cbd0f569\",\"This study evaluates the applicability of eight renewable electricity policy mechanisms for Southeast Asian electricity markets. It begins by describing the methodology behind 90 research interviews of stakeholders in the electricity industry. It then outlines four justifications given by respondents for government intervention to support renewables in Southeast Asia: unpriced negative externalities, counteracting subsidies for conventional energy sources, the public goods aspect of renewable energy, and the presence of non-technical barriers. The article develops an analytical framework to evaluate renewable portfolio standards, green power programs, public research and development expenditures, systems benefits charges, investment tax credits, production tax credits, tendering, and feed-in tariffs in Southeast Asia. It assesses each of these mechanisms according to the criteria of efficacy, cost effectiveness, dynamic efficiency, equity, and fiscal responsibility. The study concludes that one mechanism, feed-in tariffs, is both the most preferred by respondents and the only one that meets all criteria. \\xc2\\xa9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The green revolution was introduced in the late sixties, making India food self-sufficient at the national level. Even as the country accumulated buffer stocks of food, problems of hunger and starvation nevertheless persisted at the individual, household, village, and regional levels. Beginning in the late nineteen eighties, India gradually began to adopt market friendly policies. The economic crisis in 1991 set India on a path of fast track liberalization and structural adjustment resulting in comprehensive initiatives by the Government to promote the industrialization of agriculture. The government has opened up contract farming, food processing, horticulture, value added agricultural products, export crops, and biotechnology, and has allowed private corporations to invest in agriculture. This rapid industrialization is a transformative process. The social fabric matrix approach demonstrates this process where trade liberalization, scientific research, agricultural policy, and the ideology of neo-liberalism are interlocking agents shaping the contemporary industrialization of agriculture in India today. Thus, in the context of a liberalizing India, the concept of transformation replaces the term development and helps to focus our attention on a detailed understanding of the interactive institutional process of change in agriculture. The question continues to be whether or not the contemporary expansion of the agrarian sector through industrialization has served in preventing the ever-present problem of endemic hunger that nearly 320 million Indians still face. \\xc2\\xa9 2009 Springer-Verlag New York.\"\\n\"Balvers J.R., Hensen Centnerova L., Boerstra A.C.\",\"IEQ rating in LEED and BREEAM - Potential for improvement\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872670558&partnerID=40&md5=e624e8909ab31bb21eeb62b150c4672c\",\"This paper investigates the Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ)-related components of the LEED and BREEAM environmental assessment tools for new buildings.

The policy statement adopted by City Council required all large municipal building and retrofit projects to undertake an assessment of certification under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED\\xe2\\x84\\xa2) program as a design goal for Council\\'s consideration before finalization of the project design. This requirement became known as the Kingston LEED Policy for municipal buildings. Since 2004, the City has benefited from the experience gained from seven building projects that have undergone LEED assessments (three of which have been constructed and two of which are currently in construction). The potential for economic, social and environmental benefits through building to a LEED design standard have been shown in Kingston. Our experience has also shown that realization of these benefits - especially with respect to energy efficiency, requires an additional step in best practice commissioning and training of building operations staff. Based on the experience gained in completing our first three LEED projects, the City of Kingston revised its LEED Policy. Specifically, the policy was revised to ensure that as well as achieving a minimum of LEED certification for new construction the following performance based credits are obtained: \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 5 points for EAc1 Optimize Energy Performance (42% better than the Model National Energy code) \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 1 point for EAc3 Best Practice Commissioning \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 1 point for EAc5 Measurement and Verification.\"\\n\"Roderick Y., Mcewan D., Wheatley C., Alonso C.\",\"Comparison of energy performance assessment between leed, breeam and green star\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84870230159&partnerID=40&md5=7fb9e68bfe756b3be0d4ef78c2e2e4b8\",\"With the increasing awareness of sustainable development in the construction industry, implementation of an energy rating procedure to assess buildings is becoming more important.

When palm oil is extracted and processed, it also produces effluents with high organic matter, suspended matter and oil and grease. These wastes cause ecosystem degradation and affects health of the communities. This chapter describes the methods of managing or treating the residues and wastes as these are untapped resources. Some of the byproducts derivable from these wastes when appropriately managed are energy, mulch, compost or organic fertilizer from empty fruit bunches shells and sludges from effluent treatment. Empty fruit bunches and palm kernel shells were successfully converted into compost by enriching with goat manure or poultry manure and were useful in developing oil palm nurseries and other food crops. Biogas and electricity are generated from effluent management, and several biochemicals such as ethanol, fatty acids, waxes and others which could be obtained through application of biotechnology. Palm oil wastes contribute to Green House Gases (GHG) and conversion to energy is a good means of obtaining carbon credit facility for sustainable management. The spent materials are also used in cultivating mushrooms. These technologies find wider application in developing African and Asian countries where oil palm plantations are major economic resource. \\xc2\\xa9 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.\"\\n\"Shinde G.B., Sapkal V.S., Sapkal R.S., Raut N.B.\",\"Transesterification by reactive distillation for characterization and synthesis of biodiesel\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77958034191&partnerID=40&md5=40a735c93de9a3fd9d8fd97c796bdd76\",\"The awareness in alternative fuels has increased dramatically in recent years due to the rising cost and the environmental concerns related to fossil fuels use. Biodiesel represents a more environmentally friendly and cost-effective fuel produced from the reaction of various alcohols with triglycerides found in commonly available oils to produce methyl esters.Use of biofuels such as biodiesel for transportation produces no net output of carbon in the form of CO2 and achieves 30-50 % greenhouse gas savings. The techno-economic analysis of biodiesel production has indicated that cost of biodiesel will vary from Rs. 25.70 to Rs. 56.70 per liter with cost of oil ranging from Rs. 25/- to 55/- per Kg compared to Rs.36.5/- per liter for diesel. With further availability of cheap oils and taking into consideration the carbon credits earned due to green fuel under CDM mechanism, the biodiesel costs will further reduce and be more competitive with diesel. In this paper an optimized process have been investigated for biodiesel production and a case study of an innovative clean technology for production of biodiesel by transesterification using reactive distillation have been illustrated. The strong base or acid typically used to catalyze this transesterification reaction is not recovered and extensive post-reaction processing is therefore required to produce the final product. By using reactive distillation technique, energy conservation is achieved along with reduction of carbon footprints. Thus, dramatic results were obtained by using reactive distillation for biodiesel production.\"\\n\"Newell D.G., Prihantono D., Winnusa D., Chevron K.\",\"Realizing the economic benefit of CDM for geothermal energy\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77952661650&partnerID=40&md5=31fee5b385122cf5a9793e1019519deb\",\"The Darajat III Geothermal Power Project was registered with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Project No. 0673 in December, 2006.

In fact, the last two years has seen several new geothermal facilities come online, something our country hadn\\'t seen in the prior two decades. Depending on the location of these new geothermal plants, the RECs they are generating are eligible into perhaps one, and sometimes more, of these state RPS markets. Geothermal developers are therefore facing a whole new set of issues associated with the sale of their output: valuat-ing the REC, including the REC in a long term power purchase agreement (or not), and the multiple liabilities associated with a long term contract. This paper lays an informational foundation for geothermal developers facing these issues in their REC and power contracts. This presentation will cover the major issues that need to be dealt with in medium- and long-term REC purchase and sale contracts; as well as some of the solutions that participants have used to get past thorny problems. I will cover the major terms of a REC contract, including details on the risk and liabilities. I will also discuss in detail the pending Federal Renewable Portfolio Standard and the Federal REC that it will likely create, if such a law is passed. This new federal credit may play an important roll in the financing of new geothermal projects and must be addressed in any geothermal power contract. This presentation is for geothermal developers and anyone who is involved in REC contract negotiations. The landscape for renewable energy has changed dramatically in the US in the last ten years, in large part because now more than two dozen states have passed laws that require load serving entities (LSEs) to source a minimum portion of their load from renewable sources. These laws, usually called a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) (or sometimes Renewable Energy Standard, RES), usually also create and allow for the trading of a renewable energy credit (REC) for every MWh of power generated at an eligible facility. In the last ten years, a patchwork of markets has developed across the United States where RECs are traded with varying degrees of liquidity, fungibility and value. The REC markets have developed something of a reputation for being complicated, opaque, and with in-transparent pricing and trading rules. Part of the problem is that each RPS (around 28 of them) has different renewable eligibility definitions, trading rules, LSE obligations, banking rules, and other market details. And yet there is enough similarity between some state RPSs that regional tracking and trading has evolved. The REC markets present many challenges to geothermal developers. Many of the challenges are involved with these aforementioned issues and revolve around market entry strategies. However once a geothermal developer has approached the market, engaged a buyer, and is facing contract negotiations, a whole new set of issues crops up. These issues will be addressed in the paragraphs that follow. The first problem to tackle is the multiple definitions of a REC, both from a legislative position as well as an individual counterparty contractual position. Second, I will give an overview of REC transactions and how they take place. Third we will cover the major elements of a REC contract, including some of the common problems and possible solutions. Lastly, I will talk about a national RPS and how that might affect the spreadsheets of new geothermal projects.\"\\n\"Barclay S.\",\"Delphi announces plans to implement $89.3 million award from U.S. department of energy\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77951852967&partnerID=40&md5=33b9585616d2144c269ace4ec87ec6f7\",\"Delphi has announced plans to implement $89.3 million award from US Department of Energy (DoE), which will support expansion of engineering capabilities in manufacture of advanced green technologies.

LEED rates building projects based on the number of environmentally- friendly design features implemented during design and construction. As of October 2008, only four projects had been certified in the Atlantic Provinces with the Canada Green Building Council. As with the adoption of any new standard or process, individuals face uncertainty about why and when it should be adopted. New processes often face impediments and barriers that are not obvious to its creators, making adoption difficult. The goal of this research was to survey building industry members throughout the Atlantic Provinces to identify their level of LEED awareness, to identify barriers preventing them from using LEED and to identify opportunities for wider usage. Survey participants included designers, contractors, and suppliers. Sixty-six building industry members were contacted as potential survey participants. A response rate of 51 percent was achieved, with 34 individuals completing the survey. It was found that 97 percent of respondents are aware of LEED, with 94 percent interested in LEED. A large percentage of respondents indicated experience with LEED, ranging from tendering projects to working on multiple certified projects. Barriers to LEED were noted as high costs, the time consuming certification process, a lack of knowledge about how LEED works and the fact that not all LEED credits are possible in all locations. Based on the results obtained from the survey, it is recommended that monetary incentives be established to reduce increased costs, more LEED training be made available, the certification process be expedited, region specific credits be created and that increased promotion of LEED be established.\"\\n\"Humbad A., Kumar S., Babu B.V.\",\"Carbon credits for energy self sufficiency in rural India - A case study\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67949111574&partnerID=40&md5=f88a204960fe88747df6c15f5e6f3a21\",\"Carbon Credits are a tradable permit scheme under UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change) which give the owner the right to emit one metric tonne of carbon-dioxide equivalent.

Buildings are responsible of a large portion of harmful emissions and use a large fraction of the total natural resources. Moreover, the bad quality of indoor environments in office buildings can affect the health of employees, reducing their productivity. Because materials used in construction projects are responsible for a significant fraction of this environmental footprint, a better selection and use of materials could lead to a green certification such as the one given by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system. This paper illustrates how an optimization model can be used to help decision makers to select the right materials, incorporating design and budget constraints while maximizing the number of material-related LEED-based credits.

The purpose of the present study was to identify the most appropriate characteristics for extension organization toward green agriculture in Iran context. Approach: To fulfill this objective, a sample of 120 respondents was selected through simple random sampling technique. A survey study was applied as a methodology of research. A mailed questionnaire was used to collect the data. The response rate of questionnaire was 65.83% (N = 79). Appropriate descriptive statistics such as mean scores, standard deviations and variation ratio were used. Results: Extension experts believed that among important organizational characteristics of extension system for supporting green agriculture collaboration among research, extension, education organizations, farmers\\' associations, NGOs, rural credit agencies, transportation companies, considering local groups and learning organization had very high importance for supporting green agriculture. According to factor analysis, the implications for extension organization were categorized into two groups consisting: (1) Holistic organizations (2) Participatory organizations that those factors explained 67.54% of the total variance of the research variables. Conclusion: Identifying suitable extension mechanisms had important role for developing extension system. Therefore, identifying extension organizational characteristics for supporting green agriculture of Iran is one of the major approaches needs to be carefully thought and accurately implemented for the extension system development. \\xc2\\xa9 2009 Science Publications.\"\\n\"Tarbert K.R.\",\"Green up\\' air and water pollutant control: Recycling spent activated carbon can offer economic benefits and environmental credits\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70349306441&partnerID=40&md5=de1c18a4ca923d283e10fbc168464ba4\",[No abstract available]\\n\"Da Silva L., Ruwanpura J.Y.\",\"Review of the LEED points obtained by canadian building projects\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-69149085729&doi=10.1061%2f%28ASCE%291076-0431%282009%2915%3a2%2838%29&partnerID=40&md5=833d44a6428e964c0816eb1282109f96\",\"The expansion and advancement of businesses, cities, municipalities, and populations in Canada are increasingly demanding the effective usage of land and resources in building development. Companies, organizations, and individuals are seeking to construct more environmentally responsible buildings to help minimize the negative effects that structures place on the natural environment, as well as on the people that have either direct or indirect contact with them. In an effort to set a benchmark for what constitutes a green building, the Canada Green Building Council provides a certification system called Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), which is a point scheme that seeks to measure sustainability. Many stakeholders in the construction industry in Canada are increasingly employing this system to validate their achievement in sustainable development. This paper reviews the usage of the LEED system in Canadian building construction and the potential challenges and barriers associated with LEED implementation that specifically pertain to Canadian circumstances. Information from 42 new construction projects across Canada that achieved LEED certification were collected and analyzed. The points most often awarded, as well as those that are granted the least frequently, were tabulated. The percentages of points obtained were compared to American projects. Credit frequency indicators (CFIs), which were used to depict the achievement of credits by each project, can provide decision makers with information on credits awarded in the past and insight into credit implementation in future projects with similar goals. The energy and atmosphere and materials and resources categories proved to have the lowest CFIs, whereas the innovation and design process and water efficiency categories yielded the highest CFIs. The study also found that there were differences in the points obtained by LEED projects in Canada and the United States as some credits are influenced by climate, such as weather and temperature, as well as regional location. \\xc2\\xa9 2009 ASCE.\"\\n\"Newsham G.R., Mancini S., Birt B.J.\",\"Do LEED-certified buildings save energy?

These data were compared to the energy use of the general US commercial building stock. We also examined energy use by LEED certification level, and by energy-related credits achieved in the certification process. On average, LEED buildings used 18-39% less energy per floor area than their conventional counterparts. However, 28-35% of LEED buildings used more energy than their conventional counterparts. Further, the measured energy performance of LEED buildings had little correlation with certification level of the building, or the number of energy credits achieved by the building at design time. Therefore, at a societal level, green buildings can contribute substantial energy savings, but further work needs to be done to define green building rating schemes to ensure more consistent success at the individual building level. Note, these findings should be considered as preliminary, and the analyses should be repeated when longer data histories from a larger sample of green buildings are available.

In the shadows of this limelight are probably better opportunities for investment-conservation projects. Proper risk analysis is the essential tool used to divine between stereotypically mundane conservation projects and the more glamorous green power ones. Business analysts measure investment opportunities based on the predicted risk of future cash flow and its expected magnitude. As energy engineers and managers, our task is to generate projects with sufficient credibility to warrant investment. These analysts are accustomed to evaluating projects using metrics, including IRR, NPV, ROI, and other more sophisticated decision tools such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model. We as energy engineers are accustomed to conversing in Btus, kWh, therms, quads, and tons of cooling. Our role is to be the translator of expected energy impact in Btus, kWh, and other units into credible expected dollars. Failure to do this consistently, while delivering cost avoidance as predicted, is the daily challenge we face as we compete with other investment opportunities for project funds. The ongoing challenge faced by facility managers and energy engineers is how to get conservation projects funded when competing against emerging generation technology and price hedging. In most cases, particularly in periods of rapid energy unit cost escalation, the magnitude of the predicted return is not the impediment. It is the perceived relative risk of the conservation projects compared against either internal investment or generation technology. When a financial manager can refer to a measurement and verification plan which has been properly prepared and executed on an existing project and substantiates project performance (or lack of performance, along with the necessary and appropriate adjustments or causes of non performance), the likelihood of consideration of future projects increases dramatically. In contrast, if a financial manager has no substantiation of past project performance of previously funded projects, the prospects of continued funding decreases simply because there is no credible data for evaluating risk. Therefore, if we want to get more projects funded, we need to document our successes (or failures) and explain why they happened. This is no different than building a credit history. The only indicator of future performance is past performance. That is what financial analysts look at. We audit, identify, engineer, and propose projects to our managers\\xe2\\x80\\x94only to have them turned down. At the same time, careful consideration is given to alternative energy sources, or even to buying more costly \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreen power.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Why? Often, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not that the customer (think \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinvestor\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) does not understand, does not care, or dislikes saving money. Where we see opportunity, financial managers (read investors) see risk! Based on the past performance of some contractors and projects (read investments), this perception of risk is justifiable. The first rule is that you need to learn the common language, the cash flow tools: net present value, internal rate of return, savings-to-investment ratio, etc. It is imperative that we speak the language of the people holding the investment purse strings. Once you know the language, everything gets easier. Ever been in a non-English speaking country and not know the language? Try to order breakfast. Better yet, try and convince your hosts to invest in a nebulous series of cash flows based upon some indecipherable calculation constructed in a foreign language. Again, learn the language: savings-to-investment ratio, net present value, internal rate of return, discount rate, etc. Remember, in most cases selling Btus, megawatts, negawatts, therms, Mlbs, and tons of cooling to individuals who speak in dollars and cents will not work very well. \\xc2\\xa9 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, Ltd.\"\\n\"Lynch H.\",\"Out of the RED and into the BLACK with black liquor subsidies?\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77952208455&partnerID=40&md5=ec9d2d5852d410dc8bca8dc91864fd78\",\"Canada initiated Pulp and Paper Green Transformation Program to ensure the sustainable future of the pulp and paper sector.

Greenhouse gas emission reduction targets have been set in many industrialised countries. A change in current practices of almost all greenhouse-emitting industrial sectors is unavoidable, if the set targets is to be achieved. Although, waste disposal contributes around 3% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in Australia (mainly due to fugitive methane emissions from landfills), the carbon credit and trading scheme set to start in 2010 presents significant challenges and opportunities to municipal solid waste practitioners. Technological advances in waste management, if adopted properly, allow the municipal solid waste sector to act as carbon sink, hence earning tradable carbon credits. However, due to the complexity of the system and its inherent uncertainties, optimizing it for carbon credits may worsen its performance under other criteria. We use an integrated, stochastic multi-criteria decision-making tool that we developed earlier to analyse the carbon credit potential of Sydney municipal solid waste under eleven possible future strategies. We find that the changing legislative environment is likely to make current practices highly non-optimal and increase pressures for a change of waste management strategy. \\xc2\\xa9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The broader aims of organic farming are: sustainability of natural resources, minimize the cost of cultivation, provide healthy food, augment farm profits and improve soil health. Although in the market place to provide clarity on the organic claim, the organic agriculture requires certification, but broadly any system using the methods of organic agriculture and being based on four basic principles (the principle of health, ecology, fairness and care) may be classified as organic agriculture. Presently organic farming is practised on 30.42 million ha land and global market of US $ 38.6 billion is expected to reach US $ 70 billion by 2012. Area under certified organic farming in India during 2006-07 exceeded 2.55 million ha, with a total production of 586,000 tonnes and it is estimated that at least an equivalent share in the country may be under non-certified organic systems. The total export of certified organic products was 195,000 tonnes, worth Rs 3,012 million. At present there are 16 accredited inspection and certification agencies. Despite several benefits of organic agriculture reported elsewhere, there are some apprehensions that need to be answered, and the Indian scientific community has to strive hard to provide answers to some of these questions through hard-core research in organic farming under tropical and subtropical environments that exit in the country. There is greater need to undertake basic and applied research on these aspects, for which more resources in the form of dedicated team of scientists, better lab facilities and working capital would be required. On the contrary, farmers are also reluctant to convert to organic production because of constraints in availability of adequate quantities of organic manures and other organic inputs in the local market, lack of complete knowledge about organic farming principles, practices and advantages, complex and costly procedures of certification and the risks of marketing of organic produce at premium rates in domestic markets. Strategies needed to promote organic faming in India include adequate research and extension support by the government, quantification of role of organic agriculture in improving the resource sustainability and in mitigating the climate change by the researchers, acknowledgement of organic agriculture as an effective mechanism to reduce greenhouse gases and sequester carbon, recognition of organic agriculture in Kyoto Protocol carbon credit mechanisms, organic market development, mission-mode programmes for on-farm demonstrations and capacity building of all stakeholders, with full research back-up and government support for cheaper access to organic certification of farms.\"\\n\"Castro-Lacouture D., Sefair J.A., Fl\\xc3\\xb3rez L., Medaglia A.L.\",\"Optimization model for the selection of materials using a LEED-based green building rating system in Colombia\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-60549110217&doi=10.1016%2fj.buildenv.2008.08.009&partnerID=40&md5=bc7e701d985b8978e80e7ec76be5b349\",\"Buildings have a significant and continuously increasing impact on the environment because they are responsible for a large portion of carbon emissions and use a considerable number of resources and energy. The green building movement emerged to mitigate these effects and to improve the building construction process. This paradigm shift should bring significant environmental, economic, financial, and social benefits. However, to realize such benefits, efforts are required not only in the selection of appropriate technologies but also in the choice of proper materials. Selecting inappropriate materials can be expensive, but more importantly, it may preclude the achievement of the desired environmental goals. In order to help decision-makers with the selection of the right materials, this study proposes a mixed integer optimization model that incorporates design and budget constraints while maximizing the number of credits reached under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system. To illustrate this model, this paper presents a case study of a building in Colombia in which a modified version of LEED is proposed. \\xc2\\xa9 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The chemical sensor and its optoelectronic interface form an integral part of a radio-frequency tag which we have developed specifically for use as a wireless chemical and biological sensor, and which is compatible with the International Standards Organisation ISO15693 radio-frequency identification (RFID) protocol. The chemical sensor, optoelectronic interface, RFID processor and antenna are designed and fabricated on a credit-card sized tag which is operated in a passive mode using wireless energy transfer to power the sensor and read its response. The optical chemical sensing capability of the RFID tag is demonstrated by measuring pH using a thin sol-gel film containing a pH-sensitive indicator dye, bromocresol green (BCG), as a model chemical sensor interface. The film exhibits a colourimetric response to pH in the range 5.0-8.5 pH units. The optoelectronic interface of the tag comprises a silicon photodiode and two light emitting diode (LED) sources measuring the optical absorption of the pH-induced colour change of the thin film at two discrete wavelengths. The pH response curve and the pK value of the immobilised indicator were determined using the RFID tag system and compared with the results obtained using a standard laboratory spectrophotometer. A good correlation between the measurements was achieved, demonstrating the viable integration of an optical absorption based chemical sensor onto a passive RFID tag. By combining the relative advantages of simple, tuneable, optical sol-gel sensing chemistries and integrating these onto the RFID wireless communication platform, it is possible to envisage in the near future a range of new wireless sensors for distributed industrial, scientific and medical applications, in particular for smart packaging, personal (wearable) diagnostics, and infrastructure-related applications. \\xc2\\xa9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The generation of energy results in by-products called \"\"green house gases\"\" (GHGs) causing global warming. Good business practice and legislation, such as the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and the South African National Energy Efficiency Accord (2005), have put the onus on future-minded companies to make a positive response to climate change and their effect on the environment. Traditional energy-intensive underground mine ventilation designs are being challenged by ever more stringent health, safety, energy and economic issues. Over the years, \\'air factors\\' have been used to estimate air requirements for a new mine. These have been based on heat loads, gas and dust levels, diesel emissions, mining method, and production rates. Deep level mining, increasing power costs and pressure from shareholders to obtain high rates of returns require effective, and economic use of air through more innovative practices in mine ventilation design. For example, control of dust from mining operations can require between 5% and 30% of the total mine air quantity. The paper demonstrates \\'value addition\\' through an approach to underground mine ventilation design using spreadsheet-based models. A sample exercise for a diamond mine is demonstrated that could result in combined cost savings of over $17 million over the life of mine by choosing appropriate control techniques and the secondary benefits of energy reduction and carbon credits. It is foreseen that the developed cost models and the philosophies can be applied to the ventilation planning of other underground mines (example, gold, coal, platinum) for cost estimation as well as improved utilisation of air. The model can accommodate additional variables such as depth, fan pressure, fan efficiency, life of mine, ambient gaseous pollutants etc., and can be used as an effective tool in estimating the cost of environment control for an individual mine.\"\\n\"Battersby M.E.\",\"Save on taxes by going green\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67650444758&partnerID=40&md5=23e30a755f675005b972f484df8eac67\",\"The US federal tax laws have included a number of tax savings for companies that are approaching towards eco-friendly production and products under the Passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

This paper proposes a technical-economic model for underground storage of CO2 emitted by a fertilizer industry in the Northeast of Brazil, in a hypothetical mature oil reservoir through EOR operation. Simulations based on mass, energy and entropy balances, as well as economic analysis, were assessed for the process of CO2 sequestration combined with EOR. This model takes into account the energy requirements for the whole CO2 sequestration process, as well as the emissions inherent to the process. Additionally, a breakdown cost methodology is proposed to estimate the main financial determinants of the integrated EOR with CO2 sequestration (costs of CO2 purchase, compression, transportation and storage). Project evaluation is derived from a cash flow model, regarding reservoir production profile, price and costs, capital expenditures (CAPEX), operating expenditures (OPEX), carbon credits, depreciation time, fiscal assumptions etc. A sensitivity analysis study is carried out to identify the most critical variables. Project feasibility, as expected, is found to be very sensitive to oil price, oil production, and CAPEX. Moreover, there is the contribution from the mitigation of the greenhouse gas (GHG) by storing a significant amount of CO2 in the reservoir where it can remain for thousands of years. \\xc2\\xa9 2009.\"\\n\"Torres F.\",\"Back to external pressure: Policy responses to the financial crisis in Portugal\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70449383379&doi=10.1080%2f13608740902995851&partnerID=40&md5=be7550cc18b60fa08767dec414752f44\",\"The financial crisis caught Portugal in the midst of its long-protracted and slow fiscal consolidation process, which brought the budget deficit down to 2.2 per cent of GDP in 2008.

In this paper, we attempt to analyze the opposite effect of project based mechanisms including CDM, i.e. the negative impact of adoption of one project upon other potential projects. This possibility has an important implication on the technological development for the prevention of climate change, as the early adoption of a technology receives an unduly special position so that newly developed technology has relatively fewer chances of a success. Even though people disagree over many issues, there seem to be widespread agreement that technological breakthrough is a key element for the long run success of international climate policy. Thus the evaluation of the effect of mechanisms on the technology development to overcome current reliance on carbon intensive technology is important, especially in the ongoing negotiation toward new schemes to be instituted for the period following the period covered by (KP). There are several factors contributing this possible preemption property of project-based mechanisms, in the design of these mechanisms. Especially important is the baseline setting methods, so that credits from projects are computed as the excess reduction of GHG over baseline emission level. When there is an existing firm operating in an industry, adopting a mechanism employing one emission reduction technology which is registered as a CDM, then this technology itself would naturally be a candidate for the baseline for next generation of projects. However, this would set the hurdle higher for a potential project, which further reduces emissions from this technology. In return, there would be an incentive to adopt such a technology as an entry barrier for an incumbent firm. This baseline setting problem is further complicated by the fact that there are several methods proposed and also listed in the Marrakech Accord, which stipulates the concrete rules concerning these mechanisms. Given these potentially negative dynamic effects on the incentives for technological developments, of the current practices in the operation of project-based mechanisms, one important question would be the way to alleviate this kind of effects. There are several tools to be utilized from the choice of project years and extension criterion, to the possibility of changing project boundaries. We carry out this research through a simple dynamic game involving a firm considering whether to engage in a project based mechanism and a firm (inside or outside of the industry) engaging in a R&D activity. Through this, we evaluate the extent of the so-called lock-in effect of CDM so that the further incentive to develop better technology is hampered. Then we expand our analysis to the case of multiple firms operating in the industry, and also multiple firms engaging in potential R&D activities. The result is an alleviation of the adversarial effect due to competition to some degree. Also, we introduce the risk element into the model which again is well developed in the literature of R&D competition in industrial economics. Especially important is the effect of uncertainty involved in appraising the future course of international agreement. We also consider the possible alternatives to the CDM proposed somewhere which involves an upfront subsidy paid out to the project participants, instead of employing baseline-credit scheme. Uncertainty is the most important element and at the presence of multiple developers, the scheme could run into a difficulty. Another proposal compared is a streamlining of current CDM scheme which as is expected has several undesirable effects from environmental viewpoints. \\xc2\\xa9 MODSIM 2009.All rights reserved.\"\\n\"Hobbs P.R., Harrington L.W.\",\"Crop science and production technology\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056045349&doi=10.1201%2f9781420077544&partnerID=40&md5=44c75514a9882c11d46edd13422dfa42\",\"In the last 40 years, world food production has risen dramatically, resulting in improved global food security. Production of the three main food grains (wheat, rice, and maize) increased threefold between 1961 and 2006 (from 642 million to nearly 2 billion metric tons). Increased food production was a result of increased acreage and higher yields (+250%) as a result of green revolution practices: stronger plants, more nutrients, better pest and disease resistance, and more irrigation. Production increases also occurred in other crops (e.g., vegetables, oil seeds, fodders, and fruits), although some dryland crops such as pulses and small grains lost ground. The purpose of this chapter is to identify new post-green revolution technology in crop science that will help achieve future global food needs. Future increased production will be required in many crops as well as cereals as consumers demand more nutritious food and more meat-based products. Important technologies discussed include major advances in molecular biology leading to more efficient development of improved varieties and improved crop management in irrigated, but also dry rainfed environments where many of the rural poor subsist (e.g., improved rainfall harvest). Conservation agriculture is described as one way to achieve the management efficiency. Precision agriculture, presently used in developed countries, combines remote sensing with modeling to better achieve efficient crop production. In developing countries, especially in dryland areas, microdosing techniques in water and nutrient management, improved innovation systems, and networks to accelerate the innovation process will be needed. To be successful, new innovations must be made available to all farmers through effective policy decisions, available credit to purchase the technology, and accessible markets for the extra production. Computers, the Internet, and cell phones to improve communications will be useful in future food production systems for all economic levels of farmer. \\xc2\\xa9 2009 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\"\\n\"Wade C., Ernest A., Fattic J., Andrew K.\",\"Water/wastewater technician training institute: The first year retrospective\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029088611&partnerID=40&md5=8cec8a5ec0c493f7eed5877011630052\",\"The Center for Water Resource Studies and the Bowling Green Community College of Western Kentucky University formed a partnership to address an anticipated Water & Wastewater Operator/Technician shortage over the next five to seven years. The Water and Wastewater Technician Training Institute (WTTI, pronounced \"\"witty\"\"), is a joint initiative with the employment sector (a number of water & wastewater utilities/municipalities/districts), state primacy agencies and technical assistance/trade associations to refine an industry needs driven curriculum that utilizes on-line course delivery to provide options for both traditional & nontraditional students. This partnership was presented at the 2008 ASEE annual conference. This paper will review the accomplishments and the lessons learned by this program over the first year of operation. The partnership has revitalized an existing Associates Degree program entitled \"\"Water Utilities Management\"\". The program requires sixty-seven (67) credit hours, including twenty-five (25) hours of General Education Requirements, twenty-one (21) hours of Business Technology Core courses, and (21) twenty-one hours of Operations Track courses. The Operations Track courses can be focused toward either Water or Wastewater Operations. The program is designed to be delivered entirely online, allowing students to pursue their degree with unparalleled flexibility. According to the U.S. Department of Education, in 2006-07, there were approximately 11,200 college-level programs that were designed to be completed totally through distance education; 66 percent of these programs were reported as degree programs and the remaining 34 percent were reported as certificate programs. Asynchronous internet-based technologies were cited as the most widely used technology for the instructional delivery of distance education courses; they were used to a large extent in 75 percent and to a moderate extent in 17 percent of the institutions that offered college-level credit-granting distance education courses. The WTTI courses are delivered through an open-source Course Management System (CMS) known as MOODLE (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment). The first Operations Track class, entitled Water Supply & Wastewater Control was offered/developed during the Fall semester 2008. This first course, as well as a second course entitled Water Distribution and Wastewater Collection Systems will be available during the Spring semester 2009. As courses are developed, approval is sought for Continuing Education/Contact Hours from Operator Certification Boards in the individual states. Academic content is being provided by core university faculty with support from adjunct faculty eligible staff. All instructors (academic and practitioner) involved in the program are undergoing collaborative professional development to ensure that they are receptive to the unique structure of the program. As a demonstrably functional framework is being put in place, the program is being extrapolated to address other regional policy, academic discipline and industrial sector issues beyond the initial Kentucky and Tennessee target area. University-offered Water and Wastewater Operator Certificate Programs are being developed to fast-track students into the industry and allow current operators to reach advanced certification levels at an accelerated pace. Partnering utilities and municipalities are developing internship and cooperative educational opportunities to ensure work-based experiences for students. Trade associations have committed to developing scholarship programs to lessen the financial burden for potential students.

The need to instil discipline in the use of the green box measures has been a recurring theme in all of the proposals and statements made by African countries on the issue. African countries have made individual submissions on the green box measures or have joined developing countries from other regions to make submissions. One of the early views expressed by the African Group in the WTO on the green box measures is found in the Joint Proposal on the Negotiations on Agriculture presented by the Group in March 2001. It was proposed that the criteria for the green box should be tightened to ensure that measures that were employed had no or minimal trade- or production-distorting effects. The members of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) in 2002 noted the increase in the use of domestic support measures by developed countries because of box shifting. The appropriateness of decoupled support as a green box measure was raised in that submission. Egypt, Uganda and Zimbabwe presented a paper jointly with Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Sri Lanka and Honduras in which they identified direct decoupled payments and export credits and guarantees as measures which must be removed from the green box. \\xc2\\xa9 International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development 2009.\"\\n\"Prasad M.\",\"Taxation as a regulatory tool: Lessons from environmental taxes in Europe\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925456178&doi=10.1017%2fCBO9780511657504.012&partnerID=40&md5=63805eea67b1d933706a5dca6534c443\",\"Introduction Governments have always used taxation to regulate their citizens\\' behavior, from the Babylonian divorce tax of 2350 B.C. (Burg, 2004) to the latest child tax credits. The regulatory tax receiving the most attention from scholars, activists, and policymakers these days is a tax on pollution. Ever since A.C. Pigou argued that some market exchanges produce externalities that are not captured in the exchange itself, pollution has been the classic example of a market externality, and recently a carbon tax has been proposed as an alternative to the more popular cap-and-trade method of controlling pollution. Cap and trade, critics argue, causes excessive price volatility, cannot adjust for swings in the business cycle, and too easily captured by special interests. Taxation, on the other hand, is more flexible and less bureaucratic. Environmental taxes seem to be a benefit for all: They would reduce the negative outcome of bad pollution; they would generate revenue that could be used to reduce other taxes (a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdouble dividend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), or to offset the regressivity of the tax; and they would contribute to energy independence. Although at the national level American policymakers seem more interested in cap-and-trade, interest in green taxes is intense in many countries, and several American states have adopted them. But do green taxes work? Environmental taxes have been in place in several countries since the early 1990s, but the experience is mixed. \\xc2\\xa9 Cambridge University Press and The Tobin Projec 2010.\"\\n\"Lancaster A.\",\"A simplified approach for sizing green stormwater infrastructure in the city of seattle\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898454114&doi=10.1061%2f41009%28333%2961&partnerID=40&md5=4f73b21ae4d6224a616f99dc8fe0541e\",\"As part of the 2008 City of Seattle stormwater manual update, a simplified approach was developed for sizing parcel-scale facilities to meet the revised flow control requirements. The simplified, or \"\"pre-sized\"\", approach provides a relatively easy process for designers to select and size flow control facilities for smaller projects without the need for continuous flow modeling. In conjunction with a City-wide emphasis on sustainable designs, the approach prioritizes green stormwater infrastructure over traditional facilities, with an emphasis on retaining existing trees and implementing infiltration to the maximum extent feasible. Green stormwater infrastructure BMPs in the Pre-Sized Approach include retained trees, new trees, permeable pavement, green roofs, dispersion, bioretention facilities, cisterns, and bioretention planters with underdrains. The flow control benefits for each of these BMPs were quantified either as flow control credits (impervious surface reduction credits) or sizing factors (relating the facility size to the impervious area mitigated). Credits and sizing factors were developed for each of the City\\'s flow control standards and typical facility design variations. A Pre-Sized Approach worksheet was developed to guide the designer through the process of selecting and sizing facilities. This worksheet provides guidance for flow control calculations and serves as documentation for project submittal. \\xc2\\xa9 2009 American Society of Civil Engineers.\"\\n\"Haichert R., Coode J., Bajpai A., Berthelot C.\",\"Eco-Street: Quantifying energy efficiency of roads over their lifespan\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896993642&partnerID=40&md5=1736b8a2e1773919486036f517367d14\",\"The objective of this paper was to investigate the practicality and benefits of applying theoretically proposed environmental competency measures to the construction of roads, with LEED standards for building construction as the initial framework for analysis. A short coming of credit based systems for environmental evaluation is that they have the potential to reward activities of minimal positive environmental impact activities equally with activities that have a greater impact on the environment. A rating system that certifies projects on achieving a certain level of energy conservation in measureable units of consumed energy (Eco-Streets) is developed herein. To validate the rating system developed, three road design options of varied environmental impact are evaluated with the Eco-Streets rating system. For comparative purposes, the road cases are also evaluated under Green Roads; a credit-based system developed by the University of Washington for environmental rating of roadways. The results of Eco-Street and Green Roads agree other with respect to overall environmental benefit. The conventional road structure was the least desirable option environmentally, followed by remove and replace using recycled materials, with the best results for in-place recycling and full depth reclamation design option. However, there was a significant difference in total energy consumption calculated for the design options under Eco-Street with respect to the transportation of materials, there is a significant difference. Under Green Roads all options are rated equally. Since transportation of materials consumes a large portion of the energy consumed during construction, it is believed that points attributed to transportation of materials under Green Roads are insufficient.\"\\n\"Farooq U., Ahmad M., Saeed I.\",\"Enhancing livestock productivity in the desert ecologies of Pakistan: Setting the development priorities\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857805549&doi=10.30541%2fv48i4iipp.795-820&partnerID=40&md5=e6ec123afdb092472deaf4927daa28b2\",\"Livestock is now sharing by more than 53 percent of total agricultural value added in Pakistan. Identifying and developing the potential areas of livestock production is part of the overall development strategy for this sector while rural poverty alleviation is a major concern of Pakistan\\'s overall development policy. Our major livestock production systems are grazing, stall-fed and grazing-cum-stall-fed based. Grazing based livestock farming is economical and customary system in mountainous, rainfed, deserts and salinity affected areas. The livestock herders of desert areas deserve special attention of the policy-makers because of their most deprived living conditions as majority is living below poverty line by all poverty measuring standards. The present study is aimed to generate an updated synthesis based on empirical knowledge about status of livestock farming in desert ecologies of Pakistan. The results show that the average herd sizes maintained by the herders is fairly large to cover losses due to drought, disease and other epidemics. The human and physical capital endowments of the farmers are generally poor. Other common characteristics are: major dependence on natural vegetation with limited supply of fodder, more physical exertion of animals during grazing, poor animal health, practicing natural method of breeding, low milk and meat productivity, highly limited livestock and milk marketing opportunities, etc. The stall feeding is mainly composed of dry stalks and straws of different crops along with a small quantity of food grains. On marketing side, because of location and lack of infrastructure support, milk marketing opportunities are meager, therefore, it is converted into desi ghee-a value added and preserved form which is sold in nearby town markets. In marketing of live animals, the farmers are always exploited by beoparies. On average herd size, the net monthly income in Cholistan desert from cattle (for milk), sheep and goats farming (for meat purpose) was Rs 10128, Rs 990 and Rs 508, respectively; for Thal desert the corresponding estimates were Rs 457, Rs 359 and Rs 552, respectively; and for Tharparkar, the corresponding estimates are Rs 918, Rs 3221 and Rs 331, respectively. There is a strong need of prioritising development efforts for desert ecologies. High priority areas include efforts for increasing availability of rangeland vegetation and green fodder, improvement in the genetic potential of local livestock breeds, provision of more efficient livestock health coverage, and establishment of milk collection centres of milk processing plants. The low priority areas include designing regulatory framework for milk and livestock marketing, programs for human capacity building, facilitating through institutional credit, and different incentives for the veterinary staff posted in such areas. \\xc2\\xa9 The Pakistan Development Review.\"\\n\"Butera F., Levine J.M., Vernet J.-P.\",\"Influence without credit: How successful minorities respond to social cryptomnesia\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80052211683&doi=10.1017%2fCBO9780511804465.015&partnerID=40&md5=1f29ec1452fb00164866d4aa309d3ccf\",\"In October 2007, the Nobel Committee awarded its Peace Prize jointly to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the American politician Al Gore \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Nobel Foundation, 2008).

At the same time, many components of the nation\\'s traditional industrial base, such as automobile and related supply chain manufacturing, may never recover to their former levels as economic recovery takes hold. Promoting the manufacturing of environmentally beneficial products such as wind turbines or energy efficient lighting, therefore, takes on heightened importance since it will achieve multiple, widely embraced policy objectives, from job creation to reduced fossil fuel consumption. As both the quantity and sophistication of goods and services produced by these sectors of the economy increase, U.S. businesses will seek expanded sales opportunities for their products abroad. Such export sales, however, will require capital on the part of both the domestic exporter and the foreign purchaser. For businesses in the environmental and renewable energy sectors seeking capital in a tumultuous credit market, a potential source for those selling their products and services abroad is the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank).1 Importantly, Ex-Im Bank has established an Environmental Exports Program in recent years, and its authorizations for Fiscal Year 2008for renewable energy and environmentally beneficial goods and services reached $257.3 million.2 This article discusses the federal policy objectives behind government sponsorship of an export bank, the particular financing programs that Ex-Im Bank operates to support U.

In addition, we show how imposing a minimum grade requirement of C- for the math prerequisite course would influence student success in the business statistics course. Although several studies have examined the impact of different math skills, our study is the first to provide a detailed analysis of the impact of different prerequisite math course sequences on student performance in business statistics. We demonstrate that, other things the same, taking more math credit hours, taking math courses that emphasize calculus, and imposing a minimum grade of C- on the prerequisite math course have significant positive impacts on student grade performance in the business and economics statistics course. \\xc2\\xa9 2009 by Jeffrey J.

These and other data collected in the survey will eventually lead to models of shopping mode (channel) choice, intention, and frequency among other analyses. In this early examination of the data (N = 966), exploratory factor analysis is performed to identify the conceptual constructs underlying a group of forty-two general shopping-related attitudinal statements, with which respondents agreed or disagreed on a five-point Likert-type scale. From the nineteen potential constructs identified in the design stage, thirteen dimensions emerged empirically: shopping and store enjoyment, price and time consciousness, impulse buying, materialism, trust, caution, trendsetting, and opinions with respect to credit card usage, technology, exercise, and the environment. Cluster analysis is then conducted to identify seven market segments having different attitudinal profiles: store shopaholics (15%), bichannel shopaholics (14%), time-starved worriers (16%), non-materialistic greens (16%), unwired antishoppers (14%), practical and leisure-oriented (13%), and technoconservatives (11%). These segments differ significantly, in logical ways, on a number of sociodemographic and other characteristics, including shopping channel choices. Thus, more detailed investigations of choice behavior using these market segments should prove fruitful. \\xc2\\xa9 2008 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.\"\\n\"Li Y., Dong H., Wan Y., Qin X., Gao Q., Hua L.\",\"Emission reduction from Clean Development Mechanism projects on intensive livestock farms and its economic benefits\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-63549123395&partnerID=40&md5=87706845165c5d582d3afeef87fef497\",\"The livestock farm in Minhe, Shandong Province was the site of this study. Using methodology (ACM0010) approved by Executive Board (EB) of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change, greenhouse gas emission reduction was analyzed by improving chicken manure management on chicken farms and utilizing a biogas power generation system to supply electricity and displace electricity from a grid-based conventional energy source. The emission reduction was estimated to be 84666 t CO2 equivalent a year. The revenue from sale of electricity would be 7.67 million Yuan per year, and 5.93 million Yuan per year from sale of carbon credit. The payback period of investment would be 19.7 years if no revenue from carbon credit was included. The payback period of investment would be 6.0 years if the revenue from carbon credit was included. Therefore, construction of biogas digesters on intensive livestock farms to treat livestock manure and carry out power generation using the produced biogas can not only improve the environment, utilize renewable energy and reduce fossil fuel consumption, but also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and obtain revenue from the emission reduction. The CDM project will provide additional incentives for the livestock farms to construct biogas digesters.\"\\n\"Clark L.\",\"Engineering economics goes green\",2009,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-59349084780&partnerID=40&md5=f3a50505cbb786f8018b5469e2e3a644\",\"The availability of widely diverse energy savings initiatives, more sophisticated tools are needed to do reliable and credible economic analysis of an energy saving project.

At the time, almost two-thirds of America\\'s waterways were not fit for swimming or drinking. Smog from cars and factories clouded cities with a brownish haze. Tens of thousands of former industrial sites sat abandoned, containing unknown levels of hazardous substances. Mass transit systems were falling apart. Cities-especially in the Northeast-were seen as the hostile, rusting, graying remains of a rapidly passing industrial era. The suburbs presented a healthier, greener, and safer place to live. Why have cities only recently seen an upsurge in \"\"greening\"\"-from green roofs to new parks to tree planting to more energy efficient buses-despite the fact that sweeping federal environmental legislation was enacted more than 30 years ago? Quite simply, city leaders are recognizing that a cleaner environment is needed both to provide residents with a good quality of life and to compete in the global economy. America\\'s manufacturing-based economy of the twentieth century has been transformed into a service-based knowledge economy. For the information age economy, environmental quality is a major economic asset. Skilled workers are increasingly footloose, able to settle just about anywhere there is broadband Internet access, and they are drawn to healthy, aesthetically pleasing environments. Moreover, green cities are demonstrating that the alleged trade-off between jobs and the environment is a false dichotomy. A quality environment produces jobs; a polluted environment costs jobs. A green city enables a choice of transportation options, areas in which to enjoy recreational activities, and opportunities for social interaction on the street and in public spaces. And there are indications that living in a city is healthier than residing in a suburb. A 2003 study reported that people in cities weighed on average six pounds less than suburbanites and had lower blood pressure, too, because they walked more and drove less (Ewing et al. 2003). A green city has value in promoting civic pride and serving as an example to other cities. Chattanooga, Tennessee, was America\\'s most polluted city in 1969. Today it is the nation\\'s cleanest city and a thriving tourist destination (Beatley and Manning 1998). In 2007, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg put forth an ambitious plan comprised of 127 projects to improve air quality, protect water supplies, promote mass transit, plant a million trees, and expand park space (Economist 2007). Mayor Bloomberg hoped that New York\\'s green initiatives would serve as a model for other American cities to become economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable. The New York City example also reflects an effort by local leaders and citizens to do their part in addressing national and global environmental challenges, such as energy conservation and climate change. Many cities face the likelihood of substantial growth in the coming decades. The U.S. Census Bureau has projected that the population of the United States will reach 419 million in 2050, an increase of more than 130 million from the 2000 census (U.S. Bureau of the Census 2004). New York City is expecting nearly a million more inhabitants by 2030; it and other cities must become greener in order to maintain as well as enhance their livability (Economist 2007). Ironically, another reason for the growing popularity of green cities is the absence of environmental leadership at the federal level and in most states since the administration of President George W. Bush came to office in 2001. In fact, the shortage of federal and state direction goes back to the presidency of Ronald Reagan when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was seen as blatantly pro-business and antiregulation (Lash et al. 1984). Then, under the Clinton Administration, the EPA began to turn over the monitoring and enforcement of several federal environmental programs to the states. As a result, the enforcement of federal environmental laws has been inconsistent, if not extremely lax (Coequyt and Wiles 2000). Federal environmental laws set standards for air and water quality to protect the public health. They have established the environmental impact statement approach to evaluate the environmental effects of proposed development projects, and have provided major funding for sewage treatment plants, multimodal transportation projects, and some brownfield remediation. But the federal laws have largely established a reactive \"\"command and control\"\" system that does not promote the development and maintenance of good places to live and work (Shutkin 2001). Many city leaders have recognized that they cannot turn to the federal or state government for specific advice or for funding on how to create green cities. New Orleans provides a tragic case in point. The city relied on the federal government to maintain the levees along the Mississippi River and Lake Ponchartrain, only to see the levees fail in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina and leave the city flooded. On the other hand, New Orleans contributed to the devastation by allowing the draining and filling of hundreds of thousands of acres of wetlands, which then lost the ability to absorb floodwaters. The bottom line is that U.S. cities have become aware that they need to take responsibility for their environmental quality. This means investment in the city by local government, businesses, and property owners and a change in lifestyles. At the same time, an abundance of nonprofit organizations has sprung up to promote urban greening activities, from watershed alliances to park associations to community gardens to farmers markets. As a result, the greening of cities has evolved into a local public-private partnership. The federal government has provided some tools for environmental improvement, especially in the areas of clean air and clean water. Yet, the cities themselves deserve credit for creating the changes that have instilled green urbanism in people\\'s lives.

A number of ex ante studies considering the technological potential of biotechnology have proposed that this set of technologies, including genetic engineering, is distinct from Green Revolution technologies and should lead to more positive development outcomes (Barajas 1991). Notably, in contrast to the Green Revolution package of hybrid seeds and agrochemicals, biotechnologies have been said to be scale-neutral, and thus potentially beneficial to producers of any size. However, the analysis of the actual political economy of the introduction and use of genetically engineered technologies in a developing country such as Mexico, as will be presented here, leads to different conclusions. I will first introduce recent modifications to the intellectual property rights regime and to the regulation of this most crucial agricultural input, the seed. I will then analyze state responses to the new agricultural biotechnologies by reviewing the regulation of the use of these technologies in Mexican agriculture, and the position of public research on this matter. Finally, I will present the private sector\\'s outlook regarding these technologies by looking at the transgenic products that have been commercialized in Mexico so far, as well as the strategies of the only life science company of Mexican capital, Pulsar. What will come out of this analysis is that the mode of introduction of genetic engineering technologies into the Mexican countryside in the current context of neoliberal political economy does not favor their use by peasant farmers. What characterizes the general political economic context for the introduction of agricultural biotechnology in the Mexican countryside is a situation in which technological change in agriculture is the preserve of capital-rich producers. This situation is reinforced by the current credit crunch suffered by all sectors of the economy, except for finance capital-held corporations, and by the withdrawal of the state from agricultural and technological support. Moreover, the deepening process of transnationalization of Mexican agriculture has driven and is most likely to continue to drive the process of technological change, responding not to the needs of an impoverished peasantry or of a large portion of the Mexican working class, but rather to those of giant agro-industrial corporations and of affluent consumers worldwide. \\xc2\\xa9 2008 by The University of Texas Press.

Governments are seeking ways to help improve performance of their countries on this environmental issue through introduction of various policy instruments. One popular policy instrument that seems to have gained credibility with explicit mention of its application in the Kyoto Protocol is the use of permit trading and cap-and-trade mechanisms. Various political regions, countries, and even corporations have introduced, are introducing or seek to introduce this mechanism. Organizations functioning within this environment will need to manage their resources appropriately to remain competitive. Organizations will either have the opportunity to purchase emissions credits (offsets) from a market trading scheme or seek to reduce their emissions through different measures. Some measures may include investment in new technologies that will reduce their reliance on GHG emitting practices. In many countries, large organizations and institutions generate their own power to operate their facilities. Much of this power is generated (or bought) from GHG producing technology. Specific renewable energy sources such as wind and solar photovoltaic technology may become more feasible alternatives available to a large percentage of these organizations if they are able to take advantage and incorporate the market for GHG emissions trading in their analyses. To help organizations evaluate investment in these renewable energy technologies we introduce a real options based model that will take into consideration uncertainties associated with the technology and those associated with the GHG trading market. The real options analysis will consider both the stochastic (uncertainty) nature of the exercise price of the technology and the stochastic nature of the market trading price of the GHG emissions. Managerial and policy implications will be discussed. \\xc2\\xa9 2008 Springer New York.\"\\n\"Kurtz A.D., Bruck D.C., Salter C., Lubman D.\",\"Leadership in energy and environmental design for schools-2009 acoustics prerequisite and credit-Evolution and future direction\",2008,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878999525&doi=10.1121%2f1.3099348&partnerID=40&md5=abd911f2f2554c911ea20f051b7ad47e\",\"In May 2008, the U.

This paper describes the analyses undertaken to study the renewable resource potential at 15 Army sites, focusing on grid-connected generation of electricity. The resources analyzed at each site include solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, waste to energy (WTE), and ground source heat pumps (GSHPs). For each renewable generation resource, an assessment was completed to determine the level of resource availability, and the price at which that resource would be available for electricity generation. Various design alternatives and available technologies were considered to determine the best way to utilize each resource and maximize cost-effective electricity generation. Economic analysis used multiple funding options, including investment by an independent power producer (IPP), Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC), and Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP), and considered tax incentives, renewable energy credits, and other economic factors to reveal the most realistic costs possible. Where resource options proved to be economically viable, implementation approaches were recommended. The intention was to focus each installation\\'s efforts on realistic projects, moving them from initial assessment through the design and financing to implementation. Many Army sites enjoy very low costs of electricity, limiting the number of cost-effective renewable energy options where resources are available. WTE was often a viable option because of the additional revenue gathered from transferred tipping fees. GSHPs were also commonly cost-effective options for replacement in inefficient buildings. Geothermal, wind, and solar resources are found to be more available in certain parts of the country than others, reducing overall potential for use. Wind is variable and often most available in remote areas far from transmission lines, greatly increasing costs. Capital costs for solar energy are high, and the resource is also variable. Table 1 shows which resources are promising for each installation studied. Green cells indicate strong potential; yellow cells indicate small potential; red cells indicate no potential. Not all analyses are complete at this point, so some resource potential is still unknown.\"\\n\"Briller D.L.\",\"Using LEED\\xc2\\xae to facilitate the eisa goal of zero fossil fuel use in new federal buildings\",2008,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84865607993&partnerID=40&md5=01409a6d105fdac911af8420037f26c9\",\"The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) introduced numerous requirements to improve the energy and environmental performance of Federal buildings. Section 433 of EISA established aggressive fossil fuel reduction targets for Federal construction projects that exceed $2.5 million in total cost (adjusted annually for inflation) and/or require a U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) prospectus. These reductions, measured using the 2003 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) as the baseline, begin with 55 percent for projects initiated in Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 and increase stepwise to 100 percent for projects initiated in FY 2030. The U.S. Green Building Council\\'s (USGBC\\'s) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED\\xc2\\xae) system is the most widely-used and widelyaccepted sustainable building rating system in the United States. It is a performance-based, quantifiable standard that evaluates the energy and environmental performance of buildings from a whole building, full life-cycle perspective. The project developer applies for points under a system of credits, which are grouped into six categories: Sustainable Sites, Water Efficiency, Energy and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, Indoor Environmental Quality, and Innovation in Design. Based on the total points earned, buildings are certified at the Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum level. This paper will illustrate how integrative design strategies used to achieve high LEED\\xc2\\xae certification ratings at some Federal buildings can simultaneously result in substantial fossil fuel consumption reductions, consistent with the EISA objectives. Two specific strategies that exemplify this principle-under-floor air distribution (UFAD) systems and daylighting-will be discussed in terms of their energy savings potential and life cycle costs. In addition, the capability of renewable energy systems to supply the balance of the buildings\\' energy requirements (i.e., after all energy efficiency measures have been implemented) will be assessed. Lastly, key technical and cost barriers to achieving nearcarbon neutrality at new Federal buildings will be presented, and the potential for emerging technologies to address these shortfalls (including further research and development requirements) will be discussed. Actual case histories will be utilized to support the abovereferenced evaluations.

In turn, this means that power suppliers can differentiate their products to appeal to consumer tastes. While electricity is in some ways a commodity product, one major source of potential differentiation is the method of generating the power. Some renewables also clearly generate less carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per kWh of energy delivered, and they have the potential therefore to assist in meeting national or regional targets to reduce CO2 emissions. Renewable energy sources have been given great impetus by renewable portfolio standards in many US states. As a result of both consumer preferences and national targets for renewable energy production, there has been a growth in interest in renewable energy credits or \"\"tradable green certificates\"\" (TGCs) and other approaches to promote the development and deployment of renewable generation technologies. These have taken several forms, including the nature of the technologies covered by these credits and in terms of the reporting or payment obligations attached to these credits. There are many differences in national programs to promote renewable energy, by either discouraging non-renewables or encouraging renewables. The use of grants and projects to implement renewable subsidies encourages rent-seeking and bureaucratic intervention rather than integration of renewables within the overall energy market. TGCs and most REFIT programs, on the other hand, allow the government to provide subsidies to renewable energy sources in a manner that can be integrated with normal market operations. \\xc2\\xa9 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a power market model that considers renewable portfolio standards (RPS), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions cap-and-trade and green pricing programs. These are three concurrent policies in the United States that are expected to be implemented to reduce our reliance of electricity on carbon intensity sources. Under these policies, electricity generated from renewable sources would incur little or no GHG costs, and also can be used to meet RPS, or sell into green pricing programs. Therefore, load serving entities (LSEs) would view electricity as differential products and price it differently based on its emission rate. As an illustration, the model is applied to analyze the interactions of three policies using a three-node power system. The result suggests that the green premium and the price of renewable energy credits (RECs) are closely related and the interactions among three policies can effectively increase profits earned by renewables generators. RECs market needs to be carefully designed to prevent double counting.\"\\n\"Haakenstad M.\",\"Using waste heat to generate electricity\",2008,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-65249091551&partnerID=40&md5=8d278e89e5705fb17a09d243e5c6df0c\",\"This paper describes the cogeneration process at two recently constructed facilities in Colorado, which produces approximately 30% of required electric power. Topics covered include project background, system concept and operation, economic benefits, carbon footprint implications and lessons learned. This process recovers waste thermal energy through a turbine generator system and produces approximately 1MW of electric power. This electricity is used on-site, thus reducing power purchases. One or both of these plants are expected to receive green energy credits based on their qualification as \"\"recycled energy.\"\" The presentation will provide an update on the application process and credit valuation (which is currently being determined as of this writing). Recovering waste heat and using it to generate power onsite offers the potential for some facilities to increase their energy utilization efficiency. This can provide both economic benefits in the form of lowered energy input costs, and environmental benefits resulting in less energy being consumed from the electric grid. Some plants are better candidates for this technology than others. Thus this presentation will also highlight key considerations for plant owners to evaluate prior to incorporating this process application into their new or existing plant.\"\\n\"Weerasinghe U.G.D., Ruwanpura J.Y.\",\"Integration of LEED rating system with the project management process\",2008,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-63049108908&partnerID=40&md5=3db070b837f6c346ca391e4f92751a1e\",\"Until the turn of the century, there had been no proper definition for green buildings, other than mention of environmental benefits associated with such projects. During the last few years, several building assessment systems on environmental performance have emerged in different parts of the world, and in 1998, a rating system called Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) was introduced in USA, which was subsequently adopted by Canada. Based on a credit based system it is now widely recognized as a means of defining green buildings in North America. The main focus of this paper is on the project management of LEED projects, with emphasis on best practices approach for achieving LEED certification. It is based on the hypothesis that integration of LEED credit requirements with all phases of the project management process would enable the formulation of a project management model for successful implementation of LEED buildings. This integration is accentuated by indicating how LEED requirements could be incorporated with the Project Definition Rating Index, a key tool used during the pre-planning stage of a project. Although the paper is confined to the integration between LEED and PDRI, it would be representative of the possibilities that exist for incorporation of LEED with the project management process.\"\\n\"Carvalho B., Da Silva A.\",\"Clean development mechanism and the pulp and paper sector [O Mecanismo de Desenvolvimento Limpo e o setor de celulose e papel]\",2008,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-61849091407&partnerID=40&md5=9363bdd91433c84f7248cdf1a1b251bc\",\"Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) has gained importance particularly in the pulp and paper sector to face the global warming and Green House Gases (GHG) in the atmosphere.

In a tall building, the amount of useable space with a potential for the use of daylight is the space between the exterior wall and the core. This is commonly referred to as the \\'lease span\\'. Class A office buildings in the USA have typically utilized lease spans of around 45 ft (13-7 m), primarily due to efficiency of space usage. In Europe, however, lease spans in high-rise office buildings have typically been shortened due to concerns of natural light penetrations and views. For instance, in Germany, the amount of leasable space per floor is less than in the USA. The maximum allowable depth of space in Germany is typically about 18 ft (5-5 m), whereas in the USA, as much as 50 ft (15 m) is no rarity. The lease span also has an impact on other items, such as the aspect ratio, floor-to-floor height, total height and total floor area. In this study, to assess and predict daylight performance, two different requirements were analysed: daylight factor (DF) and the daylight requirement of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) 2.2 green-building rating system. The recommended average DF (DFave) ranges from 2 to 5% and LEED 2.2 requires that a minimum daylight illumination of 25 footcandles be achieved in at least 75% of all regularly occupied areas. This study conducted a series of computer simulations using RADIANCE to first show the effects of each of the fenestration parameters and then to provide an optimum effective aperture to meet the two daylight requirements in four lease span types ranging from 20 to 50 ft. As a final step, regression models and simple evaluation tools were developed to correlate the DF, daylight requirement in LEED 2.2 and the various fenestration parameters, such as window area, visible transmittance and lease span in four different cities (London, Chicago, Dubai and Bangkok). This paper provides a simplified method for evaluating indoor daylight performance to meet the two daylight requirements. This can be used as a pre-design tool, not only to achieve more credits in LEED 2.2 green-building rating systems, but also to evaluate based on DFave to ensure that the building meets the recommended level.

Texas enacted its RPS in 1999; since that time, it has added the most renewable capacity of any state and has rapidly outpaced its statutory goals. The numbers do not tell the whole story, however. This article examines the Texas RPS from two public policy perspectives seldom addressed in previous studies: the politics that shaped the statute creating the RPS and threshold judgments made by the agency implementing the statute. One factor crucial to the political fortunes of the RPS in the Texas Legislature was strategic linkage, that is, associating the RPS with related issues that had ascended high on the legislative agenda, such as competitive restructuring of the state\\'s electricity market. Once the RPS was enacted, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) aimed to build a practical policy framework in which renewable energy development overall would be a response both to the RPS mandate and to customer-driven demand. The PUCT adopted a \"\"carrot and stick\"\" approach, imposing penalties for falling short of mandated goals, while at the same time creating a portfolio of measures to ensure that the market was fully able to respond to consumer demand. The Texas experience suggests that economically sustainable renewable energy is the true underlying objective of an RPS; building competition into RPS implementation promotes economic efficiency and increases demand for renewable energy; an RPS, a system of renewable energy credits and green-power policies works best as an integrated package; the regime of rules needs to be stable; and an RPS goal need not be ambitious in order to succeed.\"\\n\"Hassett K.A., Metcalf G.E.\",\"The whys and hows of energy taxes\",2008,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38349161928&partnerID=40&md5=7cb845900845124e0e79948c43bbb5a3\",\"The new federal energy tax policy is introduced in large part on a desire to achieve energy independence by promoting domestic fossil fuel production.

The successful diffusion of mussel farming is the result of a combination of factors, chiefly, the availability of suitable water bodies; high rate of education; proximity of mussel markets and high degree of mussel consumption in the area; and a unique synergy between technology developers, promoters, and credit advancers.

The aim of this study was to determine the location of a range of resources and exposures by deprivation in a UK city. We examined the location of 42 resources in Glasgow City, Scotland, in 2005-2006, by quintile of small area deprivation. Measures included number per 1000 population, network distance to nearest resource, and percentage of data zones containing at least one of each type of resource. Twelve resources had higher density in, and/or were closer to or more common in, more deprived neighbourhoods: public nurseries, public primary schools, police stations, pharmacies, credit unions, post offices, bus stops, bingo halls, public swimming pools, public sports centres, outdoor play areas, and vacant and derelict land/buildings. Sixteen had higher density in, and/or were closer to, or more common in, more affluent neighbourhoods: public secondary schools, private schools, banks, building societies, museums/art galleries, railway stations, subway stations, tennis courts, bowling greens, private health clubs, private swimming pools, colleges, A & E hospitals, parks, waste disposal sites, and tourist attractions. Private nurseries, Universities, fire stations, general, dental and ophthalmic practices, pawn brokers, ATMs, supermarkets, fast food chains, cafes, public libraries, golf courses, and cinemas showed no clear pattern by deprivation. Thus it appears that in the early 21st century access to resources does not always disadvantage poorer neighbourhoods in the UK. We conclude that we need to ensure that theories and policies are based on up-to-date and context-specific empirical evidence on the distribution of neighbourhood resources, and to engage in further research on interactions between individual and environmental factors in shaping health and health inequalities. \\xc2\\xa9 2008.\"\\n\"Glubiak W.D.\",\"Carbon credit trading, the green movement and the demise of Milton Friedman\",2008,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-52049087187&partnerID=40&md5=ecd6bc5ac76e2d03a333386bb39dcdef\",\"The green movement, combined with advances in technology and smart investing, offers economic opportunities worldwide.

The primary carbon credits associated with composting are through CH4 avoidance when feedstocks are composted instead of landfilled (municipal solid waste and biosolids) or lagooned (animal manures). Methane generation potential is given based on total volatile solids, expected volatile solids destruction, and CH4 generation from lab and field incubations. For example, a facility mat composts an equal mixture of manure, newsprint, and food waste could conserve the equivalent of 3.1 Mg CO2 per 1 dry Mg of feedstocks composted if feedstocks were diverted from anaerobic storage lagoons and landfills with, no gas collection mechanisms. The composting process is a source of GHG emissions from the use of electricity and fossil fuels and through GHG emissions during composting. Greenhouse gas emissions during composting are highest for high-nitrogen materials with high moisture contents. These debits are minimal in comparison to avoidance credits and can be further minimized through the use of higher carbon:nitrogen feedstock mixtures and lower-moisture-content mixtures. Compost end use has the potential to generate carbon credits through avoidance and sequestration of carbon; however, these are highly project specific and need to be quantified on an individual project basis.

As concerns for environmental improvement in urban areas become more prevalent, innovative practices which create ecosystem services and ecologically functional land cover in cities will be in higher demand. Green roofs are a prime example of one of these practices. The past decade has seen the North American green roof industry rapidly expand through international green roof conferences, demonstration sites, case studies, and scientific research. This study evaluates existing international and North American green roof policies at the federal, municipal, and community levels. Green roof policies fall into a number of general categories, including direct and indirect regulation, direct and indirect financial incentives, and funding of demonstration or research projects. Advantages and disadvantages of each category are discussed. Salient features and a list of prompting standards common to successfully implemented green roof strategies are then distilled from these existing policies. By combining these features with data collected from an experimental green roof site in Athens, Georgia, the planning and regulatory framework for widespread green roof infrastructure can be developed. The authors propose policy instruments be multi-faceted and spatially focused, and also propose the following recommendations: (1) Identification of green roof overlay zones with specifications for green roofs built in these zones. This spatial analysis is important for prioritizing areas of the jurisdiction where green roofs will most efficiently function; (2) Offer financial incentives in the form of density credits and stormwater utility fee credits to help overcome the barriers to entry of the new technology; (3) Construct demonstration projects and institutionalize a commitment greening roofs on publicly-owned buildings as an effective way of establishing an educated roofing industry and experienced installers for future green roof construction. \\xc2\\xa9 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.\"\\n\"Unnikrishnan M.\",\"Green focus\",2008,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-47149095966&partnerID=40&md5=e5e2d17c9c9ad13aeac1cef5373e32c3\",\"The airline and aerospace industries in the US are cautious about the environmental stances of presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.

Using a logistic regression model, this paper evaluated the determinants of adoption of PCR among smallholder farmers in rain-fed farming systems, based on a survey of 238 farmers in the hilly area of the Loess Plateau in 2004 and 2005. Results indicated that farmers\\' socio-economic background, farm-related conditions, and institutional factors significantly affect their decision of whether or not to adopt PCR. First, the age of farmers, the size of their family, the number of ruminants owned, and farmers\\' attitude toward PCR have significant positive effects on the adoption of PCR, where the level of the family income is low. Second, the slope of the field and fallow practice variables also play a critical role in the adoption of PCR, suggesting the importance of targeting the promotion of PCR among farmers in areas affected by soil erosion. The analysis also showed that farmers\\' perception of the problem of soil erosion is positively correlated with adoption of PCR, having the most significant impact with the highest estimated elasticity. The likelihood a farmer who perceived soil erosion as a problem would adopt PCR was 225 greater than that of a farmer who did not have such perceptions. Third, the institutional variables, which are represented by contacts with extension workshops, a participatory approach, the credit and training facilities obtained, and participation in the Grain-for-Green project (PGFG), all had significant positive effects on the adoption of PCR. On the other hand, participation in the rainwater-harvesting project and in the supplementary irrigation project did not show any correlation with the adoption of PCR by farmers. Variables such as education level, the size of farms, farm tenure, off-farm employment, and distance between the farm and the farmers\\' residence did not significantly influence the adoption of PCR. This information will help prioritize factors that affect decision-making in the adoption of PCR and will provide insights into ways of increasing the adoption of PCR by farmers.\"\\n\"Wang H., Brown S.L., Magesan G.N., Slade A.H., Quintern M., Clinton P.W., Payn T.W.\",\"Technological options for the management of biosolids\",2008,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-45849138515&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-008-0012-5&partnerID=40&md5=930b156128c503b540cc548b8eef4dcc\",\"Background, aim, and scope: Large quantities of biosolids (sewage sludge), which are produced from municipal wastewater treatment, are ever-increasing because of the commissioning of new treatment plants and continuous upgrades of the existing facilities. A large proportion of biosolids are currently landfilled. With increasing pressure from regulators and the general public, landfilling of biosolids is being phased out in many countries because of potential secondary pollution caused by leachate and the emission of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Biosolids contain nutrients and energy that can be used beneficially. Significant efforts have been made recently to develop new technologies to manage biosolids and make useful products from them. In this paper, we provide a review of the technologies in biosolids management. Materials and methods: A survey of literature was conducted. Results: At present, the most common beneficial use of biosolids is agricultural land application because of inherent fertilizer values found in biosolids. Expansion of land application, however, may be limited in the future because of more stringent regulatory requirements and public concern about food chain contamination in some countries. Perceived as a green energy source, the combustion of biosolids has received renewed interest. Anaerobic digestion is generally a more effective method than incineration for energy recovery, and digested biosolids are suitable for further beneficial use through land application. Although conventional incineration systems for biosolid management generally consume more energy than they produce because of the high moisture content in the biosolids, it is expected that more combustion systems, either monocombustion or cocombustion, will be built to cope with the increasing quantity of biosolids. Discussion: Under the increasingly popular low-carbon economy policy, biosolids may be recognized as a renewable fuel and be eligible for \\'carbon credits\\'. Because ash can be used to manufacture construction materials, combustion can provide a complete management for biosolids. A number of advanced thermal conversion technologies (e.g., supercritical water oxidation process and pyrolysis) are under development for biosolids management with a goal to generate useful products, such as higher quality fuels and recovery of phosphorus. With an ever-increasing demand for renewable energy, growing bioenergy crops and forests using biosolids as a fertilizer and soil amendment can not only contribute to the low-carbon economy but also maximize the nutrient and carbon value of the biosolids. Conclusions: Land application of biosolids achieves a complete reuse of its nutrients and organic carbon at a relatively low cost. Therefore, land application should become a preferred management option where there is available land, the quality of biosolids meet regulatory requirements, and it is socially acceptable. Intensive energy cropping and forest production using biosolids can help us meet the ever-increasing demand for renewable energy, which can eliminate the contamination potential for food sources, a common social concern about land application of biosolids. In recent years, increasing numbers of national and local governments have adopted more stringent regulations toward biosolid management. Under such a political climate, biosolids producers will have to develop multireuse strategies for biosolids to avoid being caught because a single route management practice might be under pressure at a short notice. Conventional incineration systems for biosolids management generally consume more energy than they produce and, although by-products may be used in manufacturing, this process cannot be regarded as a beneficial use of biosolids. However, biosolids are likely to become a source of renewable energy and produce \\'carbon credits\\' under the increasingly popular, low-carbon economy policy. Recommendations and perspectives: To manage biosolids in a sustainable manner, there is a need for further research in the following areas: achieving a higher degree of public understanding and acceptance for the beneficial use of biosolids, developing cost-efficient and effective thermal conversions for direct energy recovery from biosolids, advancing technology for phosphorus recovery, and selecting or breeding crops for efficient biofuel production. \\xc2\\xa9 2008 Springer-Verlag.\"\\n\"Gillenwater M.\",\"Redefining RECs-Part 1: Untangling attributes and offsets\",2008,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-43249095134&doi=10.1016%2fj.enpol.2008.02.036&partnerID=40&md5=338bf7a5f22d1437029b1143d8451912\",\"Renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions markets are currently in a state of confusion regarding the treatment of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). Should consumers buy RECs or emission offsets? After examining this question, the author concludes that RECs are not equivalent to emission offset credits, and as currently defined, the retiring of a REC may have no impact on emissions from electric power generation. Consumers who purchase RECs in voluntary green power markets are providing financial assistance to renewable generators in the form of a production subsidy. Generators that sell RECs are not transferring emission reductions, since they are unlikely to have ownership or the ability to quantify reductions using a commonly accepted standard. More importantly, RECs currently sold in voluntary markets do not pass credible additionality tests and can, at best, be expected to have a market demand effect, which will be less than the supply of RECs on the market. REC definitions that use the term \"\"environmental attributes\"\" or \"\"environmental benefits\"\" are almost universally ambiguous, providing the mistaken impression that consumers are purchasing a good instead of subsidizing a public good. \\xc2\\xa9 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Large forest areas in British Columbia (BC), Canada, are infested by the mountain pine beetle (MPB). Dead wood from the infestation is expected to vastly exceed the ability of the pulp and lumber industry to utilize it; current estimates are that 200-600 million m3 of wood will remain unharvested over the next 20 years. Regions where the damaged wood is not harvested will experience loss of jobs in the forestry sector, increased risk of forest fire hazard, carbon emissions from burned or decaying wood, and uncertainty about timing of replanting since this usually occurs at harvest. This paper reports the results of a detailed preliminary techno-economic analysis of producing power from MPB killed wood. Power plant size and location are critical factors affecting overall power cost. Overall cost of power rises steeply at sizes below 300 MW net power output. By locating the power plant in an area of high infestation, transportation distances can be minimized. A 300 MW power plant would consume 64 million m3 of wood over a 20-year lifetime, and hence is a significant sink for otherwise unharvestable wood. Cost estimates are based on harvesting of whole dead trees with roadside chipping and transport to a central power plant located in either the Nazko or Quesnel regions of BC. A circulating fluidized bed boiler with a conventional steam cycle is a currently available technology demonstrated at 240 MW in Finland. The estimated power cost is $68 to $74 per MWh, which is competitive with other \"\"green power\"\" values in BC. Given recent values of export power in the Pacific Northwest, a 300 MW MPB power plant is viable with a carbon credit below $15 per tons of CO2. \\xc2\\xa9 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Renewable electricity typically has two components, i.e., the power itself, measured in kw-hr, and renewable energy credits (REC), also known as green tags or tickets. Two camps have different views of the best way to use REC to meet environmental and resource planning goals. The more conservative camp believes that regulatory regimes should never allow REC to be sold separately from the energy that generated them because such separation gives utilities that purchase REC to meet their RPS a \"\" license to pollute.\"\" The other camp - the REC trading camp- feels that renewable energy development will benefit more if REC and their associated energy are allowed to be sold separately. The REC trading camp continues to gain adherents as transmission resources are unable to keep pace with growth in renewable generation. Because they are powered by an intermittent resource, wind farms have an average capacity factor that rarely exceeds 40%. This has three negative and related consequences. One of the obstacles preventing wind plants from becoming a first-rate electricity resource is the inability of wind farm owners and developers to accurately predict and guarantee wind energy delivery.

As a R&D center of an international IT corporation, there are data centers in the two buildings, which make them different from typical office buildings. The data centers house high energy consuming IT equipments and need 24 h air-conditioning every day all year round. In order to achieve energy cost savings, multiple energy efficiency strategies are employed for design proposed building, encompassing high performance building envelope, lighting system, and HVAC system. Through energy modeling, the design proposed options are compared to an ASHRAE 90.1-2004 compliant budget model to highlight energy cost savings versus \"\"standard practice\"\" and show the potential LEED\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 Credit EA1-Optimize Energy Performance. Meanwhile, they are also compared to China Code model to figure out the energy cost savings versus the most popular practice conforming to China Public Building Energy Saving Design Standard. The whole building energy simulation results show that the yearly energy cost saving of the proposed design will be approximately 27% from China Code building and 21% from ASHRAE budget building, which can achieve 4 points for LEED credit due to energy performance optimization. \\xc2\\xa9 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Current climate models predict a global warming of about 1.4 5.8\\xc2\\xb0C between 1990 and 2100 [5]. These projections are based on wide range of assumptions about the main forces driving future but do not assume any climate change policies for reducing emissions. The pulp and paper industry is a significant emitter of green house gases. Despite the proportion of industrial plantations devoted to pulp production, plantations do not appear to be offsetting emissions from energy use or landfills. Production, consumption and disposal of paper products are estimated to contribute a net addition of about 450 million tons in carbon dioxide equivalent units each year. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) is the foundation of global efforts to combat global warming. Adopted in 1992, the UNFCC sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations for greenhouse gases to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. India has signed Kyoto protocol in December 1997, ratified in August 2002 & established DNA in December 2003. The CDM is based on the emission reducing projects located in developing countries, selling carbon credits to buyers in industrialized countries.

The review will establish an environment in which all timber certification schemes can be assessed in a transparent and equitable manner. The council has determined that the best way to approach the MAT-8 Sustainable Timber credit is to specify a set of leading best practice criteria under which a submission from a particular project can be assessed.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is taking a detailed look at these matters as part of a review of its decade-old guidelines on environmental marketing claims. As part of the effort, FTC is giving special attention to emerging markets for carbon offsets and renewable energy certificates. To guard against such false claims, FTC enforces a federal law that prohibits unfair or deceptive trade practices. Under this law, companies must have a reasonable basis for the claims, environmental or otherwise, that they use in marketing their products. Another focus for FTC is getting a handle on carbon offsets and renewable energy certificates, which are gaining popularity. Renewable energy certificates come from generators of electricity from wind, solar, and other renewable sources that sell their power into the grid. However, they also sell the renewable attributes of their electricity separately.

This paper shows how targeting financial actors has allowed NGOs to transform their rather weak discursive power base into instrumental power over business actors in other sectors. NGOs have channeled their power through states, consumers, and financial institutions; this has allowed them to augment discursive power over their targets with additional indirect, yet more immediate, forms of structural and instrumental power. As a consequence of both direct and indirect NGO pressure, financial institutions have adopted environmental policies. This article posits a theoretical explanation of the underspecified power relationships in NGO strategies that allow NGOs to exploit weak links in commodity chains for their campaigns. This paper argues that financial institutions wield considerable structural power through their ability to control access to finance. It is particularly this power base which has made them prime targets for NGOs campaigning for the greening of infrastructure development projects. As a consequence of NGO pressure, financial institutions have adopted environmental policies which in turn have provided the World Bank and Equator banks with additional sources of discursive power.

Three graduate credits from Endicott College were made available to participants in each institute. After the summer sessions of each institute, participants designed and field tested in their own classrooms a lesson on alternative energy. At the end of each institute, participants received kits of small electrical parts or SNAP circuits and digital multi-meters to use with their classes. During the summer of 2006, a 45-hour Summer Content Institute entitled STEMS (Science, Technology and Engineering for Middle Schools) was held at Northern Essex Community College in Massachusetts. The STEMS Content Institute provided educators at the Grade 6-12 level with science and engineering/technology content and context. The content was aligned with the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks for Science and Technology/Engineering and with the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks for Mathematics and provided solid integration of key scientific and mathematical concepts with the engineering design process. In this institute, participants explored the generation of electricity by the alternative energy sources of wind, water, and solar. Participants engaged in lab activities, completed worksheets and visited a \"\"Green Home\"\" powered by a wind turbine and by both passive and active solar energy.

Conversely many of the current green building rating systems are structured to promote solutions that are iterative, dissective, and additive, inadvertently encouraging consumption over conservation. This outcome can often be traced to how the programs were initially conceived, that is, as a set of sections that make for sustainability, which are then filled with technologies and products to achieve that sustainability. This result is exacerbated by the industry itself, where every manufacturer or subcontractor wants their environmental activity recognized with points toward green certification. An alternative conceptualization of a green building rating system might be primarily developed around overall designs rather than on discreet specifications. This alternative system might determine a buildings environmental responsibility through measures of overall resource consumption, such as volume and mass of structure per occupant, site distance from existing infrastructure, or regenerative connections of building systems with the environment. Once these base design aspects are accounted for, the specifics of systems, products, and materials could be evaluated (with a much lower overall score percentage) toward the building\\'s total environmental rating. In this way, green building rating systems might better promote the use of resources in designs that emulate natures holistic, integrative, and reductive processes. \\xc2\\xa9 2008, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

The installation of a 500 kWdc solar photovoltaic energy plant allows NJAW to achieve strong financial results, while providing clean, reliable, and cost saving energy to the benefit of our customers and stakeholders.All of the power generated from this dual array ground-mounted system is utilized on site without exporting to the electrical grid. About 15% of the peak usage of the treatment plant is now supplemented by the system, reducing the amount of electricity that must be purchased from outside energy suppliers. Additionally, energy is produced at times of peak loading on the grid, decreasing stress on the grid, while creating the most valuable energy in a time-of-day rate environment.In addition to energy savings, the system produces a new yearly revenue stream for the company via the sale of tradable solar-specific renewable energy credits that electric marketers are mandated to acquire to meet the NJ Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard.The installation of the system has had a very positive public relations benefit by demonstrating NJAW\\'s commitment to preserving the environment.

Although its contribution to the GDP has declined over the years, the farming sector remains one of the essential economic activities since it provides food and nutritional security. It also contributes significantly to employment, income generation, poverty alleviation and the environment. However the sector continues to be unorganised and underdeveloped. This is because there are no central bodies that lobby for it with policy makers. While in markets, traders can form cartels, the farmers reaching such Agriculture Produce Markets Regulation Act (APMC) mandis are at the mercy of traders, and receive a price already fixed by such cartels rather than being able to collectively decide to sell to traders at a price remunerative to them. The farming sector remains underdeveloped also because the benefits of growth are yet to reach them. In terms of technology and inputs, the access of farmers to these is restricted by their limited ability to purchase them. Also the prices received by farmers for their products in the last few decades have been declining over the years. The other concern is the uneven growth trajectory among different sections of the farming community within a region. For example, farmers growing wheat and mustard in Rajasthan have differential earnings (Multi Commodity Exchange [MCX] field surveys). This is due to the access to irrigation, technology, credit facilities, etc. made available in certain regions. \\xc2\\xa9 Cambridge University Press India Pvt.

Ironically, the historic preservation movement and the environmental movement both derive from the same intent to provide stewardship of the environment. The preservation movement largely has focused on the built environment with some more recent efforts recognizing the broader environment of cultural landscapes. Conversely, the environmental movement has largely been seen as a tool for stewardship of the natural environment. At the surface, both movements may appear to be opposite sides of the same coin with overlapping and at times seemingly conflicting agendas. For those familiar with the long-term tenets of thepreservation movement, this is a false perception since within the historic preservation movement it has long been known and accepted that reusing existing buildings is one of the most sustainable forms of stewardship of the environment. This article explores the growth and emergence of the preservation movement as an increasingly recognized and important form of sustainable design in contemporary society. The efforts for historic preservation and environmental conservation have resulted in two programs-the Federal Tax Incentive Program for Historic Buildings, administered jointly by the United States Department of the Interior and the United States Department of Commerce, and the LEED Rating System administered by the United States Green Building Council-that each separately defines a model for stewardship of the built environment. The article provides an overview for the preservation and environmental movement that would appear to some as two entirely divergent strategies for proceeding with construction activity for a more sustainable future. The truth is that a number of synergies exist that can be used to multiply the benefits of historic preservation and environmental stewardship. This synergy will be further explained in the case study that explores the successful rehabilitation of the W. P. Fuller Paint Company Building completed by the Big-D Construction Company for use as its office headquarters in Salt Lake City. This project (see Figure 1) is among the first to simultaneously incorporate LEED and Historic Preservation Tax Incentives to achieve a Gold rating by LEED while meeting conformance requirements to the Secretary of the Interior\\'s Standard for Rehabilitation and earning a 20% historic preservation tax credit.\"\\n\"Boake T.M.\",\"The leap to zero carbon and zero emissions: Understanding how to go beyond existing sustainable design protocols\",2008,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77953338379&doi=10.3992%2fjgb.3.4.64&partnerID=40&md5=eb5e1dfb107894bba35993aef8cd756c\",\"The greening of North American building seems to be taking hold. The intended market transformation of the LEED\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 Certification system appears to be working. Statistics show that the numbers of certified green buildings in both the United States and Canada are increasing at an exponential rate. The proposed changes to the USGBC version of LEED\\xe2\\x84\\xa2-2009/V.3-are intended to support changes in the system that recognize differences in credit values as well as regionalized differences in the required approach to green building. The introduction of LEED\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 for Homes and Neighborhoods has extended the potential influence of the program beyond the original commercial building marketing target. ASHRAE\\'s proposed Standard 189.1 is also taking aim at increasing the standards for high-performance Buildings of a non low-rise residential variety. However, with continuing environmental degradation, and more recent escalating concerns about global warming and CO2 levels in the environment, it is becoming clear that even the highest standards of construction that are being implemented in North America today are simply not enough. While the design and construction industries in the United States and Canada scramble to adopt and evolve green building guidelines such as LEED\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 to increase their rigor and range of applicability, the United Kingdom is advancing in the implementation of regulations that are specifically intended to control carbon emissions, and not just for commercial buildings. Great Britain has already adopted policies that require all new housing stock to be carbon neutral by the year 2016. They are working towards the implementation of carbon taxes to motivate companies to look closely at the way that they consume energy and goods, and reward citizens that show initiative in responding to this crisis. The act of carbon counting is beginning to permeate a multitude of sectors in the UK. The issue of carbon is not a simple one. There is carbon involved in the extraction of the resources that we use to create products; in the transportation of these products to the site; in the physical construction of the buildings; in the operation of buildings; and in the lives of people as they carry on business. In order to be able to reach a state of carbon neutrality, lifestyle changes will be necessary. The status quo cannot be simply modified to reduce its carbon cost. Consumption patterns must change. Buildings and their programs may require downsizing or creative reinvention. Understanding the definitions of the terms that are associated with this elevated movement is important. This article will examine the means by which to understand the potential of ratcheting up the performance requirements of existing North American green protocols to achieve carbon neutral standards, as well as how to interpret and extend existing assessment criteria to highlight and include carbon neutral interests.\"\\n\"Todd J.A., Boecker J.\",\"Continuous improvement of the U.S. green building council\\'s leadership in energy and environmental design LEED\\xc2\\xaerating system\\xe2\\x84\\xa2\",2008,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-76649090620&doi=10.1520%2fJAI101095&partnerID=40&md5=a54f725d230f31a1683c38ea84fec3dd\",\"The U.S. Green Building Council\\'s (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Rating System\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 has had a significant impact on the market in the United States and is beginning to affect markets around the world.

In Italy, energy requirements of the residential sector, in fact, represent about forty percent of the overall energy balance. The majority of this consumption could be avoided by simply providing strict building-design guidelines and promoting energy efficiency in existing buildings through proper energy retrofit interventions. The achievement of higher standards for households\\' heating and cooling has the highest potential to lower the related primary energy consumptions and green house gases (GHG) emissions. This article focuses on an original energy policy that has been issued in the municipality of Reggio Emilia, Italy, called riduCO2. Several reasons make this project innovative.

Sub-Saharan Africa (hereafter referred to as Africa) is, however, the only region in the world where per capita agricultural productivity has remained stagnant over the past 40 years. In Asia and Latin America, the use of tailored techniques and technologies has transformed agricultural practice and its productivity, leading to what has been called the \"\"green revolution.\"\" The dissemination of uniquely African green revolution technologies has not occurred on the continent. This chapter will argue that the same results in increased productivity and food security can be achieved in Africa if the appropriate investments are made in key interventions: soil fertility improvement, improved seeds, water management, market access, extension services, access to credit, and improvements in weather forecasting. Where these have happened, even partially, the outcome has been remarkable. However, bringing them to scale in ways that sustainably increase agricultural productivity and alleviate poverty requires increased investments and innovative institutional arrangements. Fortunately, several research and development projects on the continent, including the Millennium Villages Project, are providing valuable insights. Finally, this chapter outlines the key remaining challenges. \\xc2\\xa9 2008 New York Academy of Sciences.\"\\n\"Jones S.A., Fortmeyer J.\",\"Credit union goes green\",2008,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-44649105115&partnerID=40&md5=9c1be0b4cae7d0a228f38ef1a30b37a0\",\"The Kern Schools Federal Credit Union Administration Building located in Bakersfield, Calif., is the first LEED\\xc2\\xae-certified building in California\\'s Central Valley.

First, the serious fi lmmaker endeavors to inform the audience about what happened-or what is thought to have happened. This might include reference to particular dates or the accurate wording of a speech that was given on that documented date. Even though that understanding may be contested by historians, we still might call it the intellectual part of the dynamic. However, a second factor also enters the equation, because the fi lmmaker must appeal to the public\\'s expectations about how the time period \"\"felt.\"\" Can the fi lmmaker convey the feelings of terror and elation of war and victory? The gloom of an economic depression? This is the emotional side of the equation, and it plays an equal, and sometimes larger, part in how a fi lm treats the past. This emotional side is further complicated by the fi lmmaker\\'s desire to dramatize-and possibly make judgments about-what happened. Consider, for example, how a fi lmmaker in the 1950s might portray an important political/military event like the rise of Genghis Khan. Students of history in fi lm have just such an opportunity by studying Howard Hughes\\' The Conqueror (1956), which off ers both a sobering and humorous example of how Hollywood treated epic history on an epic scale in the 1950s. The fi lm\\'s locale is Mongolia during the 1200s, but the Cold War made shooting on location entirely out of the question. This dilemma more or less necessitated fi lming closer to home, in Utah to be more exact. Then, too, because movie studios believed that a fi lm had to feature easily recognized movie stars, and those stars were Caucasian, The Conqueror succumbed to some legendary miscasting: envision John Wayne as Temujin, the Mongol who ultimately attains the title of Genghis Khan. If this selection seems odd, imagine the shapely, red-haired, green-eyed beauty Susan Hayward as Bortai, a Tartar princess. As if to introduce some ethnic authenticity, Pedro Armendariz plays Timugen\\'s brother, but his Spanish-fl avored English is as odd as the stiff lines that all the characters voice in this epic. The Conqueror was produced toward the end of that golden period in which fi lms began with a bow to the written word, often a page or more of text to set the scene historically. Text like this scrolls upward as it informs viewers about the period, location, events, and characters. The Conqueror begins with an enigmatic written disclaimer just before such textual wording appears: \"\"This story, though fi ction, is based on fact.\"\" That disclaimer is ambitious in that the facts are only vaguely determinable in the fi lm, which is mostly conjectural. Nevertheless, it suggests that many, if not most, historically themed fi lms might employ a version of it: \"\"This story, though supposedly factual, is based on fi ction.\"\" The fi ction, of course, is the conjecture that the fi lmmakers introduce concerning geographic locale, artifacts, and-most importantly-dialogue and motive. The additional text appearing on the screen at the opening of The Conqueror provides an overview of the period in which barbarians stormed across the Asian steppe-a time of treachery when \"\"brother could not trust brother\"\" and \"\"rapine\"\" was common. This wording provides a simplistic overview of complex events, but it prepares the viewer/reader for the drama about to take place. In a deeply subliminal sense, it harks back to the Old Testament times of Cain and Abel, and the barbaric times depicted in paintings like \"\"The Rape of the Sabine Women.\"\" Reading words like these, we sense that we are about to witness some genuine betrayal and mayhem. As The Conqueror\\'s introductory wording loosely sets the historical background, the desert landscape \"\"sets the scene\"\" as the Asian steppe. From the left of the screen we hear the increasing crescendo of hoofbeats just as the camera moves left to catch a thundering herd of riders on horseback that fl ashes across the screen from left to right as the words THE CONQUEROR take up the full screen. Like most fi lms set in the distant past in distant places, The Conqueror required sweeping desert vistas to authenticate its barbarian promise. As The Conqueror\\'s director, Dick Powell faced the challenge of portraying an isolated desert region halfway around the world almost a thousand years ago. Despite his best eff ort, Powell wound up giving both Mongolia and Mongolians the strangely familiar look of the old American West. There is something familiar about the way Wayne rides his Mongolian horse, for he had done it in numerous westerns. Then, too, that landscape looks awfully familiar because the spectacular Utah desert doubles as the Gobi. The fi lmmaker\\'s use of Utah for Mongolia was easy to excuse: despite Utah\\'s familiarity, virtually no viewer but a geographer would sense any real miscasting here because, viewers were unsure and could be easily convinced that the Gobi looks just like what they were seeing on-screen. This is a reminder that all audiences- popular or academic-are remarkably unaware of geography-probably even more unaware than they are of history. The fi lmmakers of the period further conspired to keep their \"\"exotic\"\" locale secret by not revealing the locations in the credits. The Conqueror is widely known as a career killer because the fi lm\\'s cast reportedly succumbed to cancer in disproportionate numbers. That has been attributed to nearby nuclear testing (even the hauling in of radioactive Utah dirt to the Hollywood soundstage where part of the fi lm was shot), but this colorful interpretation is largely apocryphal and more in the category of an urban legend. This environmental explanation somehow overlooks Wayne\\'s three-pack-a-day habit and his subsequent death from lung cancer two decades after the fi lming. But The Conqueror, which is regarded by some critics as the worst historical epic ever shot by Hollywood, needed something to distinguish it, and nuclear testing may help to explain its status as both killer and bomb.1 I began this essay by highlighting The Conqueror because it typifi es so many American fi lms that portray the exotic, southwestern Asian deserts, and the people who inhabit them, as barbaric and sensual. For example, when Wayne and his fellow tribesmen ogle a sensuous dancing woman at a gathering, we learn that she is from Samarkand. The salacious words that \"\"compared to such women from Samarkand, all others are like the second pressing of the grape\"\" reveals just how much fantasy can go into a historical epic. But The Conqueror was meant to be taken seriously as a fi lm about Asia, and it has all the elements we commonly associate with the East-wisdom and stupidity, bravery and cowardice, opulence and poverty, kindness and torture. But fi lms about another part of the East-the Middle East-are the ones that I would like to discuss in greater detail. Like The Conqueror, these fi lms depict a region and the peoples who inhabited it in times past. In the Middle East, however, the stakes are higher, because the region was, and is, central to three religions that continue to coexist, if uneasily at times. Unlike the way we experience The Conqueror, however, we take these fi lms more seriously because they are about a serious subject-religion.

A spate of enthusiastic writing about the promise and accomplishments of Harold Washington in the early 1990s was matched by an equally critical and dismissive literature by skeptical academics who argued that the change under Washington was ephemeral, piecemeal, and contradictory at best. Perhaps the major obstacle to appreciating Harold Washington has been making sense of what followed him-the economic transformation of Chicago into becoming a global city and the nearly two-decade reign of Mayor Richard M. Daley and his designation as \"\"progressive\"\" by The New Republic (Beinhart, 1997; Madigan, 2004). Daley combines the patronage skills of the past with a commitment to investing in \"\"urban amenities\"\" and putting Chicago on the world stage. At the same time, he has taken on such tough issues as reforming public education and transforming public housing while being an innovator in launching citywide campaigns promoting benefits for working families like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Even the most trenchant of urban critics have been charmed by this bold and incoherent mayor who has survived endless scandals and defanged political opposition while planting trees and transforming Chicago into a green city. \\xc2\\xa9 2007 State University of New York.

These programs are of historical interest not only because of their international success,4 but also because they were often scripted by blacklisted writers. Since the publication in 1980 of Ceplair and Englund\\'s The Inquisition in Hollywood, it has been known that Ring Lardner Jr. and Ian McLellan Hunter wrote scripts for \"\"Robin Hood.\"\"5 It has also been known that a key role was played by producer Hannah Weinstein and by her company, Sapphire Films. Since then, a number of publications have added to the list of blacklisted writers, the TV series to which they contributed, and our knowledge of the part played by Sapphire and Weinstein.6 It is now known, for instance, that Norma Barzman, Robert Lees, Adrian Scott, Maurice Rapf, and others wrote scripts for \"\"Robin Hood\"\" too, that Lardner and Hunter wrote scripts for \"\"The Adventures of Sir Lancelot\"\" and \"\"The Buccaneers\"\" in addition to those they wrote for \"\"Robin Hood,\"\" and that Waldo Salt wrote scripts for \"\"Robin Hood\"\" and \"\"Ivanhoe\"\" as well. It is also known that these scripts were either written pseudonymously or were allocated a pseudonymous credit at some point during production. However, the contributions made by Lardner, Hunter, and Salt to \"\"Sword of Freedom,\"\" and by Salt and others to \"\"The Buccaneers,\"\" have rarely been noted. Precise details as to which writers wrote which scripts under which names are in short supply. Given the secrecy that surrounded their work, the fading memories of those who worked on the series, and the partial nature of available archival evidence, it is now probably impossible to provide these details in full. However, a number of largely untapped archival sources, notably the letters, papers, and scripts of Ian McLellan Hunter, Ring Lardner Jr., Robert Lees and Fred Rinaldo, Waldo Salt, and Adrian Scott,7 do exist. Using these sources in conjunction with some of the published accounts listed above, I aim to add more flesh to the bones of existing records. I also aim to add new names, such as Hy Craft, Howard Dimsdale, Arnaud D\\'Usseau, Anne Green, Millard Lampell, Arnold Manoff, Sam Moore, Arnold Perl, Fred Rinaldo, and Janet Stevenson, to the list of blacklisted contributors. First, however, I want to underline the importance of the role played by Weinstein and Sapphire. Hannah Weinstein was born Hannah Dorner in New York in 1911. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s she worked as a journalist, publicist, and campaigner for radical causes. She was a supporter of Roosevelt\\'s New Deal and campaigned for thirdparty presidential candidate Henry Wallace in 1948. After Wallace\\'s defeat and her failed marriage to Peter Weinstein (and just prior to HUAC\\'s second series of Hollywood hearings), she left the United States with her children in 1950 and went to France. There she produced her first film, Fait divers \\xc3\\xa0 Paris (1952), and renewed contact with a number of Hollywood exiles, among them Ben and Norma Barzman, Lee and Tammy Gold, John Berry, Jules Dassin, and Abraham Polonsky, all of whom had gone to France in the late 1940s and early 1950s. With Polonsky and Boris Karloff, in whose house in France she initially lived, she began planning a TV series, \"\"Colonel March of Scotland Yard.\"\" She then went to London in 1952 and in an uncredited capacity produced three pilot episodes that were reedited and released in 1953 as a feature film entitled Colonel March Investigates. On the basis of these pilots, a series was commissioned and distributed in the United States by Official Films. Blacklisted writers, among them Walter Bernstein and Abraham Polonsky, wrote scripts for \"\"Colonel March,\"\" which Weinstein again produced in an uncredited capacity. Cy Endfield, who had been blacklisted in the early 1950s, directed the three pilot episodes.8 \"\"Colonel March\"\" was a moderate success. With the advent of ITV in Britain now imminent, Weinstein set up a new company, Sapphire Films, in 1954, planning further TV productions and planning, too, to provide further paid employment for blacklisted writers. She began negotiations with Official Films in the United States and with Associated Television (ATV) and its subsidiary, the Incorporated Television Programme Company (ITP), in Britain for production funding and for regional, national, and international distribution for a new series, \"\"The Adventures of Robin Hood.\"\" Once the project was agreed, initial outlines and scripts were written in New York by Ring Lardner Jr. and Ian McLellan Hunter and edited (in an uncredited capacity) by Howard Koch, a blacklisted writer living in London.9 Filming began at Nettlefold Studios in Surrey early in 1955, and on location in the countryside nearby. \"\"Robin Hood\"\" was an instant success. It was followed in rapid succession by \"\"The Adventures of Sir Lancelot,\"\" \"\"The Buccaneers,\"\" and \"\"Sword of Freedom,\"\" all produced by Weinstein and Sapphire, all funded and distributed by ATV, ITP, and Official Films, and all frequently scripted by blacklisted writers. Unlike like \"\"Robin Hood,\"\" \"\"Sir Lancelot,\"\" and \"\"The Buccaneers,\"\" \"\"Sword of Freedom\"\" failed to secure network distribution in the United States and received notably lukewarm reviews.10 The swashbuckling trend was continued by \"\"Ivanhoe,\"\" \"\"The Adventures of William Tell\"\" (which was initially transmitted in the United Kingdom between 1957 and 1959 and syndicated to local TV stations in the United States in 1958), \"\"The Adventures of Sir Francis Drake\"\" (initially transmitted in the United Kingdom in 1961-62 and on NBC in the United States in 1962), and \"\"Richard the Lionheart\"\" (initially transmitted in the United Kingdom in 1961-62).11 But Weinsten and Sapphire turned away from swashbucklers and went on to produce \"\"The Four Just Men\"\" (1959-60), an adventure series based loosely on the novel by Edgar Wallace.12 Episodes of \"\"The Four Just Men\"\" were scripted by Ring Lardner Jr., Ian McLellan Hunter, and other blacklisted writers.13 However, the escalating costs associated with extensive location shooting and a cast of four rotating stars (Richard Conte, Dan Dailey, Jack Hawkins, and Vittorio De Sica) led to the demise of Sapphire and \"\"The Four Just Men\"\" and helped prompt Weinstein\\'s return to the United States.14 When she left the United Kingdom in 1962, reruns of \"\"Robin Hood\"\" were still being broadcast. When she arrived in the United States, it was still in syndication and was to remain so for many years to come. \\xc2\\xa9 2007 by Rutgers University Press.

But who are the poor, and how can we find where they live? How do we reach them in our development attempts? It is surprising to realize that these apparently simple questions have yet to be answered objectively even after billions of dollars have been invested in development programs. Typically, poverty is measured by computing how far a number of households stand with respect to a \"\"poverty line\"\" (e. g. the price of a minimum food basket). Based on this concept many economic analyses have \"\"shown\"\" that increased food production should have a positive impact on alleviation of the world\\'s poverty (rural and urban population taken as a whole, in a pareto optimum). As a result (and the fear that countless developing countries people would succumb to famine because of high population growth) the Food and Agriculture Organization and the Consultative Group for International Agricultural research centers (CGIAR) have focused on alleviating hunger and poverty primarily through increases in food production, which made them key actors in the green revolution. While the World Bank was funding most of the green revolution programs, its bilateral programs relied on essentially two poverty alleviation strategies: promoting structural adjustment programs (SAP) in developing countries and funding programs (mostly as a safety net to the SAP) on credit and infrastructure to protect that part of their population deemed vulnerable to the adjustment. In more recent years, the linkage between these implicit and quasi-one-dimensional assumptions and the broader human conditions of well-being and poverty have been called into question.1 This resulted in most development organizations\\' committing to a better understanding of the causes and dynamics of poverty and venturing into a much more complex domain than anticipated. On the other hand, there is increased concern about the relevance of a process traditionally engaged in by various development actors and about the best paths that lead to poverty alleviation. Apparently, the success of poverty alleviation programs is hardly related to factors that were used for their design. This perspective contradicts the accepted logical-positivist view that technical knowledge about poverty is linked directly to the policy message (McGee and Brock 2001). Technical knowledge, however, remains very influential in decision making, while the same poverty diagnostics procedures based on an economist\\'s viewpoint continue to be the ones favored for development policy. For example, the World Bank, after a selfassessment of the low efficiency of its former poverty-reduction strategy (and partly in response to worldwide criticism), seems to be willing to move toward a more integrated approach. A good example of the new World Bank paradigm comes in the form of a large-scale study referred to as Voices of the Poor, an unprecedented effort to gather, using participatory methods, the perceptions and aspirations of sixty thousand poor men and women from sixty countries. Unfortunately, not much seems to have happened since the final reports were written, and the standard procedure to estimate global poverty rates remains simply the $1 (or sometimes $2) per capita per day threshold (World Bank 2001).2 In parallel, most development NGOs, which have traditionally opted for bottom-up approaches focusing on local development-while rejecting World Bank-type poverty alleviation programs designed from the top-are now asking for better information and science to achieve impact beyond the intervention areas and to connect their work with broader-scale initiatives (Webb, Woo, and Sant\\'Anna 1995). Finally, many governments of developing countries have set up highly targeted and uniform policy instruments to fight poverty that are adjusted to local conditions (e.g., through their own poverty estimates and poverty maps) as well as to the requirements of development banks. Consequently, it is extremely difficult to do a nationwide characterization of poverty (or its alleviation programs) that is acknowledged as appropriate by all development players. On the one hand, specific surveys (e.g., living standards measurement surveys, or LSMS) are not only expensive and time consuming, but are also biased toward a first-world economist\\'s view. Participatory poverty assessments, or PPA (Grandin 1988), are also extremely time-consuming and therefore generally done in only a few communities, are often affected by reliability problems (Bergeron, Sutkover, and Medina Banegas 1998), and generally cannot be extrapolated beyond the study sites. On the other hand, comprehensible information is available nationwide from surveys such as housing and agricultural censuses. These censuses are done with the purpose of characterizing demography and agriculture (to help governments and banks) and not specifically to estimate poverty.3 Several studies, mostly from World Bank researchers, have linked surveys such as the LSMS to censuses via regressions (a method known as small area estimations) to improve the geographical detail and comprehensiveness of poverty maps (Hentschel et al. 1998; see also Henninger 1998 and Davis 2003 for reviews of poverty mapping methods). Censuses are so detailed, however, that it should be possible to connect them with full local assessments such as PPAs and, taking advantage of their wide geographical coverage, map the local knowledge at the scale of the country. The focus of this chapter and its counterpart, chapter 36, is to summarize our work that does just that for Honduras. I examine methodological issues related to the characterization, measurement, representation, and geography of poverty. Although a large body of literature can be found on the subject, traditional methods address facets of poverty not easily related to agriculture and natural resource-management decision making (Carvalho and White 1997). In 1997, the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) embarked on a research project to define a unique approach linking commonly used ad hoc measurements with geographical representations of poverty from community-level, locally constructed well-being rankings (Ravnborg 1999) to standardized maps of national-level rankings. Contrary to proposing a single, unifying poverty index, such as proportion of population below a given income value, we support the design of indexes that target the specific needs of various decision makers, including Ravnborg\\'s well-being index. This poses, however, a formidable challenge. In effect, a prerequisite for catalyzing collective action is a shared vision, and shared visions cannot be created and communicated using unrelated component images. Adopting a standard poverty measure helps everyone to rally to the same perception (for good and bad), while these different viewpoints on poverty that I propose to explore will have to be exchanged and discussed to catalyze collective action. We (myself and colleagues such as Ravnborg) take the position that poverty reduction is a process where several viewpoints (hence poverty measures and representations) must be compared and argued. In this chapter I start by showing how the richness of raw (political unit-level) national census data can be used to produce nationwide poverty indexes tailored to particular needs. I then introduce the results of the independent study by Ravnborg (1999) where locally relevant indicators of well-being were determined by analyzing information collected through participatory exercises in ninety Honduran villages. I then link these two independent, ad hoc databases, one derived from national censuses and the other from village-level questionnaires, by standardizing the unit of analysis. The result can be viewed as an example of a common knowledge base that can help bridge the communication gap between national perspectives and local community perspectives, in which affordable information technology plays a key role. In chapter 36, I examine methodological issues for contrasting several representations of poverty indicators (including the ones derived here) for various aggregation levels and classification choices to illustrate the effect they may have on poverty alleviation policy. I complete the study by describing a prototype of a simple, user-friendly interface to raw census data to allow others to represent poverty in various ways and explore without restraint from the World Wide Web. \\xc2\\xa9 2007 by the University of New Mexico Press.

Indeed, a general characterization of states before the 1970s holds them to have been \"\"backwaters for the worst excesses of American politicians and bastions for the most shameful of American policies\"\" (Lowry 1992, 10). The states were \"\"mired in corruption, hostile to innovation, and unable to take a serious role in environmental policy out of fear of alienating key economic constituencies\"\" (Rabe 2003, 295). Because \"\"states failed to act\"\" (Dwyer 1995, 1185) and federal \"\"efforts to prod states to act had failed\"\" (Percival 1995, 1144), in the 1970s the federal government undertook numerous massive initiatives on behalf of environmental protection, many of which subsequently depended on state implementation and provided for optional, subsidized state participation. These new federally established opportunities and subsidies forced and inspired extensive environmental policy capacity building by the states. This occurred as the states were already engaging in numerous institutional and constitutional reforms (Van Horn 1989). Thus by the early 1980s, when the federal government began to seek actively to devolve environmental responsibilities to the states, the states were able and willing to respond. By the late 1980s scholars were beginning to point to the \"\"resurgence of the states\"\" (Bowman and Kearney 1986) and were situating states at the \"\"cutting edge of environmental policy\"\" and innovation (Rabe 2003; Van Horn 1989). Even so, into the early years of the twenty-first century, state initiative and innovation continue to be facilitated by federal policies, grants, technical assistance, data collection, research, and coordination (Rabe 2003). If anything, this \"\"jumpstart\"\" explanation is assumed to apply even more in the conservative western states than in the more populated, economically diverse, and greener East. Yet this conventional wisdom contains troubling anomalies, not the least of which is that it offers no explanation for the many instances of state environmental policy innovation that have not been the result of prodding by the federal government. The jumpstart explanation seems to derive in part from two widespread analytical biases of environmental policy scholars. One of these biases is \"\"Washington centeredness,\"\" which assumes that because so much environmental policy seems to be linked to Washington, D.C., it must be the primary stimulus, either proximately or ultimately, for any state policy activity that occurs. A second analytical bias involves giving short shrift to history. Even pioneer efforts to assess state pollution control policies offer unsupported claims that prior to 1970, \"\"states made little systematic progress in the fight against pollution (Lowry 1992, 15) and that \"\"most states paid little attention to environmental protection\"\" (Ringquist 1993, 20). But in fact the states, including western states, were environmental policy innovators for decades prior to the 1970s, with many significant accomplishments to their credit, and they would continue to innovate in innumerable ways beyond the demands and incentives of federal policies and in policy areas barely touched by federal efforts. Environmental policy innovation is best understood as a phenomenon in which both the federal government and the states respond to historical forces, the same forces that drive modern environmentalism and the emerging outlines of the environmental problematique. Much of the innovation in environmental policy has always occurred at the state level, and this is true in the West as much as anywhere. \\xc2\\xa9 2007 by University Press of Colorado.

While the classical definition of performance of a building is based on safety and serviceability criteria, the definition for high-performance buildings for sustainable developments is based on additional criteria mostly related to energy and environment such as improved energy, economic, and environmental performance. The guidelines for defining these criteria include imprecise, or linguistic measures (e.g., \"\"high\"\", \"\"medium\"\", or \"\"low\"\"). These types of measures would lead to soft/fuzzy evaluations that cannot be added using simple mathematical or probabilistic models. Using the theory of possibility, a new robust metric for evaluating sustainability in buildings is being developed. This new metric is necessary because existing evaluation systems such as LEED and Green Globes lack the ability to gain partial credit and overlook the existence of several types of uncertainties associated with the evaluation process. A case study, presented here, demonstrates how the new metric integrates definitions across existing sustainability measures using possibility distribution. \\xc2\\xa9 2007 American Society of Civil Engineers.\"\\n\"Field C.\",\"The relationship between good acoustic design practices and sustainable building design\",2007,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84873943334&partnerID=40&md5=01e2252de63e157d69c74cab1a285ddf\",\"This paper deals with the importance of acoustic design in sustainable building design. With the increased awareness of the causes of climate change, several green building rating systems are now in place around the world. The intent of these rating systems is to define a standard for sustainable buildings, promote integrated building design, and create awareness of building design issues affecting sustainability. Most of the rating systems are broken down into categories in which credit points are earned: sustainable site location, water efficiency, energy, materials and resources consumption, indoor environmental quality and design innovation. Within these categories, however, there are no explicit requirements to maintain acoustic amenity, or promote good acoustic design practices. The relationship between good acoustic design practices and sustainable design is presented. Examples of the significance of acoustics to all aspects of sustainable design are discussed, including aspects not currently dealt with in green building rating systems - in society, the environment, natural resources and the economy. Proposals to include specific acoustic design credits for green building rating systems are also given.\"\\n\"Kachur M.\",\"The greening of sound: Recent inclusion of acoustics in sustainable building certification\",2007,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867805603&partnerID=40&md5=6ef030ec367150c7bde33f1fe59f7a1e\",\"The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED\\xc2\\xae) Green Building Rating SystemTM lacked explicit credit for acoustical design prior to 2007.

Wastewater streams from refineries, petrochemical plants, power plants and similar mediumscale industries have traditionally been treated by a variety of technologies, such as solvent extraction, froth flotation and oil water separation. Advantages of the System in comparison to conventional treatment include modularization, which makes the System adaptable to changing waste streams; the ability of the System to handle various waste streams and zero-liquid discharge (ZLD).Low cost, renewable landfill gas (LFG) has been used to fuel the System, as well as waste heat from landfill gas fueled generators. The use of landfill gas significantly reduces the cost of treatment compared to other processes. Many Systems are presently operating at landfill sites located in the Central portion of US where significant volumes of refinery wastewater are produced. Left untreated, LFG, which contains high concentrations of methane, is discharged to the atmosphere where the methane significantly contributes to the green house effect. When LFG is used to fuel the System, carbon credit contributes significantly towards the revenue in Kyoto Treaty-bound countries. This process can generate carbon credits within the US by \"\"fuel switching\"\" and if a site is not regulated for actual carbon capture; the System can help achieve a Carbon Footprint Reduction. A typical process is a modular, skid-mounted System that includes tanks for storage of wastewater, for storage of saleable liquid product in waste streams, and in some cases, tanks for storage of separated oil. The System also includes an LFG-fired evaporator, a demister for capture of large water droplets, and a discharge stack (or an LFG-fired flare). Ancillary support equipment includes a dewatering system, utility supply and distribution system and a PLC-based control system within a stand-alone control trailer. The unit is well suited to utilize waste heat from LFG-fueled generators producing electricity or from other hot-gas sources including boilers, furnaces and gas turbines. When a waste heat source exists at a site of industrial wastewater generation, an inside-the-fence zero liquid discharge can be achieved.

The proposed model was built in Crystal Ball software and the simulations were performed using Monte Carlo techniques. In our model, we applied two different mechanisms to support renewable energy development: the environmental benefits associated to the sale of the carbon credits and the incentives derived from the governmental grants. In windy locations or high wind turbine capacity, the simulation results revealed that the use of the environmental benefits in the NPV calculation is more profitable than the governmental grants, allowing renewable energy technologies to compete with conventional power production. Nonetheless, it has been shown that in less windy location, the small wind power projects are still depending on the governmental support. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated the importance of the clear and consistent mechanisms to compensate the customers who sell and deliver their excess generation to the electric grid. \\xc2\\xa9 2007 RPS.\"\\n\"Lewis D.\",\"The price of sin\",2007,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38849103635&doi=10.1049%2fpe%3a20070510&partnerID=40&md5=188c4a91bc6fd8fda9191d948afb72ef\",\"Carbon footprints, introduced by Kyoto Protocol\\'s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), allows industrialized countries with a green gas reduction commitment to invest in developing countries that can reduce carbon emissions at a much lower cost.

In the context of growing interest in green buildings, this research effort focused on the role of constructors in the green building process as integral participants on a LEED project. The research identified how constructors can understand the impacts of various LEED-NC requirements on their roles and practices in executing green projects, which can equip them to become a value-adding member of the project development process. One of the primary aspects of understanding LEED requirements is to focus on those credits that require constructors\\' direct involvement. This was achieved by categorization of LEED-NC credits, into \"\"major,\"\" \"\"moderate,\"\" and \"\"some\"\" impact levels to facilitate constructors\\' understanding of their roles in providing input on these credits. This categorization can also assist constructors to plan for the activities required to achieve these credits. Early involvement of a constructor can also provide the owner and designer with information related to cost implications of pursing certain LEED credits. The constructor\\'s team can develop \"\"what-if\"\" scenarios of cost implications of pursuing specific LEED credits. In addition, the constructor can also undertake lifecycle cost analysis of materials and products to determine the optimum solution based on the owner\\'s requirements.

For that purpose, we developed a linear optimization model that evaluates three waste disposal systems such as landfill, incineration and ash melting. Also, we assumed that LFG recovery power generation, and the incineration system and the ash melting system can be combined with the electric power generation. In addition we evaluated the effect of CDM that is considered as a measure to reduce GHG emissions in the local city in China. The results obtained in this study are as follows. (1) In Tokyo, where the maximum landfill area is restricted, the waste disposal system is incineration and will change to ash melting. In China, where the maximum landfill area is larger than that in Tokyo, the waste disposal system is landfill and will change to incineration. (2) The electric power charge is an important factor to use LFG to generate electricity efficiently in developing countries where the waste disposal system is landfill. (3) In developing countries, if GHG credit is approved, LFG leakage decreases and the amount of LFG power generation increases.\"\\n\"Andreola F., Barbieri L., Corradi A., Ferrari A.M., Lancellotti I., Neri P.\",\"Recycling of EOL CRT glass into ceramic glaze formulations and its environmental impact by LCA approach\",2007,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-35748962300&doi=10.1065%2flca2006.12.289&partnerID=40&md5=bb2e6ca862fea82684c30112737709cc\",\"Background, Aims and Scope. The interest in recycling materials at the end of their life is growing in the industry in general. As regards the Wastes of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), an appreciable increase of these materials has been noticed in the last decades, 117 \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 103 tons of WEEE have been produced in Italy in 2002 according to Ecohitech [1] and the increase in this kind of waste is three times higher than that of the municipal waste according to the FISE ASSOAMBIENTE report [2]. Within WEEE, End-of-Life Cathode Ray Tube (EOL CRT) glass, the main part of TV sets and PC monitors, is here analysed using both a technical approach to establish a possible reuse of the glass in a open-loop recycling field (ceramic industry) and a methodology (LCA) capable of providing environmental evaluations. Methods. The technological characterization was performed by chemical resistance tests (UNI EN ISO 10545-13), staining tests (UNI EN ISO 10545-14) with blue methylene and potassium permanganate (KMnO4), and surface abrasion tests (UNI EN ISO 10545-7). The LCA study was conducted using the SimaPro 5.0 software and Eco-Indicator 99 as an evaluation method. Results and Discussion. The good technical results, reached by using cleaned EOL CRT panel glass inside a ceramic glaze formulation instead of a commercial frit, are supported by the environmental impact evaluation, which shows a decrease of the overall potential damage (measured in Points) of 36% and, in particular, a reduction of 53% in \\'Human health\\', 31% in \\'Ecosystem quality\\' and 24% in \\'Resources\\'. Conclusions. This study has demonstrated that this new, open-loop recycling strategy for the CRT glass significantly reduces the environmental impact of the ceramic glaze production process. In fact, in all damage categories examined in this study, there is a minor impact. An improvement is evident in the respiratory inorganics sub-category related to the lowering of dusts mainly and to a lesser amount with NOx and SOx in the climate change sub-category, due mainly to the reduction of CO2 emission correlated to the avoided combustion of the mixture which feeds melting furnaces in the frit production. Thus, the damage decrease in \\'Ecosystem quality\\' is prevalently due to the lower NOx emissions by the kilns in the frit production that is evident in the acidification/eutrophication sub-category. Finally, the significant saving in the \\'Resource\\' category is principally linked to the fossil fuels sub-category, thanks to the methane saving which stokes the melting furnaces. Perspectives. Furthermore, the decrease in CO2 emission (94.4%) evident in the climate change sub-category is a very important topic because it is in line with the Kyoto protocol (1997), where significant efforts have been exerted for the reduction of the green house gases emission, notably CO 2. The CO2 emission is correlated to the combustion of the mixture which feeds melting kilns in the frit production, therefore the recycling of secondary raw materials, already in a glass state, can reduce the emissions of this gas. This reduction can be termed as environmental credit and it is an example of an allocation of environmental loads in a open-loop recycling, where waste from one industrial system are used as raw materials in another product system. \\xc2\\xa9 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe H\\xc3\\xbcthig Jehle Behm GmbH).\"\\n\"Hamilton A.\",\"Sustainability: Walking the walk\",2007,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34948862899&partnerID=40&md5=d769c959e24ec749b52f8dcd258446b3\",\"Several areas where printers can implement sustainable business practices, ways to implement them, and the requirements to demonstrate that company is operating in an environmentally sensible manner, are discussed.

Development of bioenergy projects may cause competition for biomass resources. For example, sawmill residues are an attractive feedstock for bioenergy, but are also utilised for particleboard manufacture. This study compares the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation impacts of alternative scenarios where sawmill residues are used either for generation of electricity or for manufacture of particleboard. The study considers a theoretical particleboard plant processing 100 kt feedstock of dry sawmill residues per annum. If the sawmill residues are used instead for bioenergy, and the particleboard plant utilises fresh plantation biomass, 205 kt CO2eq emissions are displaced. However, GHG emissions for particleboard manufacture increase by about 38 kt CO2eq, equivalent to 19% of the fossil fuel emissions displaced, due to the higher fossil fuel requirements to harvest, transport, chip and dry the green biomass. Also, plantation carbon stock declines by 147 kt CO2eq per year until a new equilibrium is reached after 30 years. This result is influenced particularly by the fossil fuel displaced, the relative efficiency of the fossil fuel and bioenergy plants, the moisture content of the sawmill residues, and the efficiency of the dryer in the particleboard plant. Under MRET, calculation of Renewable Energy Certificates is based solely on the quantity of power generated. This study illustrates that indirect consequences can reduce the GHG mitigation benefits of a bioenergy project. Increased emissions off-site, and loss of forest carbon stock, should be considered in calculating the net GHG mitigation benefit, and this should determine the credit earned by a bioenergy project. \\xc2\\xa9 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, the effects of selected environmental and \"\"green\"\" energy policy schemes on co-generation of on-farm biogas energy production and other co-benefits from anaerobic digestion of livestock manure were investigated. Cost-efficiencies arising from economies of scale for on-farm anaerobic biogas production were found for swine farms, and less so for dairy production systems. Without incentive schemes, on-farm biogas energy production was not economically feasible across the farm size ranges studied, except for 600- and 800-sow operations. Among single policy schemes investigated, green energy credit policy schemes generated the highest financial returns, compared to cost-share and low-interest loan schemes.

Two notable new, well-funded policies such as the $3.2 billion California Solar Initiative (CSI) and the proposed \"\"Securing America\\'s Energy Independence Act (HR550)\"\" - which would provide a $3,000 per kilowatt federal tax credit for solar installations, are great for business. For example, California\\'s CSI will cost ratepayers $3.2 billion, but will provide over $6 billion in incremental savings by avoiding electrical infrastructure costs. The Governor\\'s desire to achieve the results of this program within ten years - a short time frame for such an ambitious project is wise. Delay simply reduces the benefits available to Californians and dilutes the impact the state can have on cost-effectively improving its energy infrastructure, the environment, and the economy. As the timeframe for program implementation stretches out, the lost opportunity costs, in the form of infrastructure costs incurred, pollution not abated, and jobs not established, increase substantially. Moreover, designing a long-term program provides certainty for the necessary manufacturing and installation infrastructure to meet these goals. If the experience of Japan is any indication, at the end of this ten-year period there will be a sustainable solar industry in the state that will no longer require incentives and will continue to provide the benefits outlined in this paper for future years and will be unlike any other in the U.S. In summary, there is a set of guiding principles which will ensure the development and implementation of an effective, cost- and time-efficient solar systems program that will deliver the benefits envisioned by the Governor\\'s Office. These principles are: Include and quantify all of the benefits and costs of solar power when evaluating the program Create dynamic, market-based incentives that drive end-customer behavior Base analyses on actual market data to ensure effectiveness Retain the 10-year timeframe to provide assurances for long-term industry investment The true drivers of the solar market are end-customers making purchase decisions in each segment. Although there is a great deal of political support for solar power among various segments of the population, at the end of the day these purchase decisions are economic decisions in which the customer roughly calculates his/her own net benefit from adopting a solar technology. As shown in the above chart, the customer calculus includes all of the factors driving the cost of the solar system and comparing those to the potential savings the system can provide plus any \"\"public good\"\" factors (e.g., contributing to improving the environment). The current lack of a sufficiently adequate economic payback for many potential customers is a plausible explanation of why adoption rates are still relatively low, even thought very high levels of support has been expressed towards reusable energy. For consumers, while the public good benefits of solar are often what may motivate a customer to investigate solar in the first place, it is important to note that the purely economic equation must work for a purchase decision to be made. A recent survey of photovoltaic dealers regarding their customers\\' characteristics indicates that those consumers who make decisions purely or even mostly on environmental grounds are a small percentage of total purchasers, and in fact, an increasing proportion of new customers were motivated primarily or exclusively by economic factors. Commercial customers are entirely motivated by the economic benefits achievable through solar adoption, which include near-term savings, insulation from future electric rate increases, and promoting their own businesses through solar use. Government customers are often similarly motivated, with some exceptions where the government entity wants to set an example by adopting solar. Obviously, programs like CSI and HR 550 are great for business since they help to jump-start an entire industry. In addition, they are terrific for the environment. As a result, it\\'s going to be a green light for investments in the solar industry with these policies in effect. CSI and HR550 are examples of successful policies, but Cleantech companies should not stand on the sidelines waiting for the policy pendulum to swing their way. If a company or industry has solutions that, when fully implemented, are good public policies, then by all means these companies could actively advocate for favorable policies. Companies should indeed consider where their technologies are most beneficial, and then advocate for public policy that would accelerate their market adoption. Policies can be created by businesses.\"\\n\"Comet P.\",\"A plan for sustainability\",2007,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34548218288&partnerID=40&md5=2ddc3ec77fd27d437a6a56231f60f0ce\",\"There is a link between lack of sustainability and global warming. One example is the cost-effectiveness of cellulose-based fuel (which is only 73% combustible) compared with coal, oil, tar sands, and natural gas. Hence, products shipped to the US that use fossil fuels in manufacturing would have to be subjected to an import carbon tax, which would be used in carbon fixation projects. Over time, the fossil carbon tax would increase and the consequently subsidized credits would also increase. Electric companies would have the opportunity to undergo a green transformation by using their own profits. Consumers of gasoline would be able to offset part of a carbon tax by extensive recycling of their carefully separated and weighed garbage. A carbon credit/debit card could be used. By yoking the world\\'s economic systems to the carbon cycle (using a carbon tax and carbon credits as incentives), the problem of global warming could be solved. By using the organics in the waste stream as a largely carbon-neutral principal fuel and recycling all the incombustibles, and approximate reduction of 60% CO2 emissions can be envisaged.\"\\n\"Scheer F.\",\"Cereplast markets biobased plastic blends\",2007,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34548704062&partnerID=40&md5=67284437372f8ab8019ef71d7fb32985\",\"Cereplast Inc. markets the 12 different types of biobased plastic resins containing polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) as well as starch.

The quantification of the environmental benefits of renewable energy projects is of utmost importance for: 1) the creation and trading of certified emission reductions or credits and 2) the design of green energy government policies that recognize the contribution of renewable energy for the reduction of national/regional carbon emissions. The proposed approach is based on the correlation factor between time-evolution of system marginal emissions and wind power generation. Results show that average displaced emissions by wind generation can be estimated once typical power system dispatch data and regional wind generation is available, thus circumventing the use of proprietary power dispatch models. The main objective of this work is to contribute towards the development of simplified methodologies that will facilitate the assessment of renewable energy projects in a variety of regulatory and regional settings. \\xc2\\xa9 2007 IEEE.\"\\n\"Wilts R.\",\"Rehab it\",2007,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34447271252&partnerID=40&md5=ce615261d936521dd76157eff830eec4\",\"The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System awards credits to those who reuse existing building structures.

The probability of adoption also increases with increased targeting of institutional variables: credit obtained, assistance obtained, and technical training received. Farmers in villages that have more erosion problems are more likely to adopt RHSIT. Besides, the model indicates that a 1 unit increase in the diversity of irrigated crops grown by a household, especially high-value crops, results in a 6.98 times increase in the probability of RHSIT adoption. Variables such as family size, off-farm activity, level of family income, risk preference, and land tenure do not significantly influence adoption.

LEED certification has been visualized to be lacking in its performance and the emphasis is more given on just good intention. The documentation required for LEED certification neglects the factor of good design and the associated high cost and long duration, if certification is another demerit of the system. The prime intention of the LEED certification is to enable designing environmentally sustainable building designs. Industry experts expect the LEED certification to create more opportunities for innovation and design credits and address regional sustainability issues.

This requirement to pre-pay energy presents a difficulty in comparing the economics or effective cost and/or savings of energy delivered by a solar system to the cost of conventional energy sources. The purchase and installation of a solar system to heat water or generate electric power essentially locks in the cost of the energy at a fixed price over the life of the solar equipment. Once a solar system is installed, the price of the energy delivered is locked in at a levelized or life-cycle cost rate based on the cost of the solar system installation, and its operating and maintenance costs over the life of the system which is between 10 and 25 years depending upon the type of system. This article illustrates a simplified approach for developing the effective cost of solar applications to the cost of conventional alternatives. The effective cost of solar water heating and photovoltaic (stand-alone and grid-connected) systems are determined to illustrate the methodology. Given the present uncertainty of the cost of fuel oil, natural gas and electric power, locking in the price of energy delivered by a solar system for heating water at two to five cents per kWh or $5.00 to $15.00 per million Btu is a good investment with or without the available tax credits, State and local incentives and/or environmental benefits. The economics of the photovoltaic systems varies significantly with the system type (stand-alone or grid connected) and utility rates and rate structure and is not as clear-cut as the solar thermal systems. It is something that should be given serious consideration. At the present time, the price of solar energy applications can be locked in at a 30% discount using the federal solar tax credit that is part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Additionally there may be other state and local incentives that may be available for solar. The environmental benefits that range from reduction in particulate emissions and CO2, that can earn Green Tags yielding income, to the positive image for marketing of being environmentally friendly, i.e. green hotels, encouraging ecotourism etc., also provide an intangible financial benefits for some businesses.

The cost was added so the credit could be removed later during cost management meetings. It was soon realized because there was no clear sustainable direction from the owner, that sustainability here is a piecemeal approach that adds another layer of responsibility for middle managers. In contrast, during a schematic design meeting an owner took an enterprise approach to the project and developed a facility and program that made sense with the site. A green approach was used in the whole site design. As a result, clusters of LEED credits were obtained and the construction cost of the site was reduced. With this integrated enterprise approach it is very hard to remove individual sustainable credits; the procedure is integrated with the middle managers\\' current tasks and is not an added layer. The earth\\'s biosphere has evolved into a complex thriving sustainable system. In contrast, organizations are an unsustainable force that threatens the earth.

Method: One hundred and two sequential visually impaired (average age 73.8 \\xc2\\xb1 14.8 years; 59% female) in a single center optimized a dynamic television image with respect to edge detection filter (Prewitt, Sobel, or the two combined), color (red, green, blue, or white), and intensity (one to 15 times) of the overlaid edges. They then rated the original television footage compared with a black-and-white image displaying the edges detected and the original television image with the detected edges overlaid in the chosen color and at the intensity selected. Footage of news, an advertisement, and the end of program credits were subjectively assessed in a random order. Results: A Prewitt filter was preferred (44%) compared with the Sobel filter (27%) or a combination of the two (28%). Green and white were equally popular for displaying the detected edges (32%), with blue (22%) and red (14%) less so. The average preferred edge intensity was 3.5 \\xc2\\xb1 1.7 times. The image-enhanced television was significantly preferred to the original (P < .001), which in turn was preferred to viewing the detected edges alone (P < .001) for each of the footage clips. Preference was not dependent on the condition causing visual impairment. Seventy percent were definitely willing to buy a set-top box that could achieve these effects for a reasonable price. Conclusions: Simple generic edge detection image enhancement options can be performed on television in real-time and significantly enhance the viewing of the visually impaired. \\xc2\\xa9 2007 Elsevier Inc.

These markets have been used in Europe to promote generation of electricity from renewable resources like wind. Similar markets have been proposed in the United States of America (USA) where the certificates are called Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). The certificates are issued to the generating companies for each megawatt-hour of renewable electricity generation. The companies may sell the certificates in a market, and the revenues from certificate sales provide an extra incentive to invest in new generating capacity. Proponents argue that this market-based incentive can be designed to support government mandates for a growing fraction of electricity generation from renewable sources. In the USA, these mandates are set by the states and are known as Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS). We simulate the price dynamics of a market designed to support an aggressive mandate for wind generation in the northwestern USA. The simulations show that the certificate price climbs rapidly to the cap in the early years after the market opens. Investors then react to these high prices with construction of new wind capacity. After a few years, wind generation meets, and then exceeds the requirement. We show that this pattern appears again and again when the simulations are repeated with wide variations in the estimates of behavioral parameters. We use the model to study the impact of different trading strategies by the wind companies and by the distribution companies. We also study the simulated market response if the USA adopts the carbon allowance market envisioned in The Climate Stewardship Act. The article concludes with recommendations for policy makers involved in TGC market design. \\xc2\\xa9 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The little public access space that currently exists in large urban areas, i.e. parks, allotments and brown field waste ground, can require extensive travelling for many, is often unsafe due to the attraction of undesirable elements, the land is often contaminated or planting that has been undertaken is repetitive and unsuitable for honey bees. This paper discusses a novel food production scheme - urban beekeeping - which assists the survival of biodiversity in urban centres. This is currently being undertaken as part of a PhD project funded by the EPSRC and Highbury Builders Collective at the University of the West of England in the UK. This project is being field-tested across a number of North London inner boroughs and is attempting to tackle issues of local community involvement, especially young people in healthy food production, and identifying the importance of a wide variety of vegetation for this purpose. The study has evolved out of a number of needs, one of which is to redesign a beehive that can be accessible to more people, namely young people and disabled people. A second need is to redesign a beehive which can provide more comfortable internal conditions throughout the annual climatic cycle for bees and hopefully reduce the decline of bee numbers during the winter months. One of the necessities of urban beekeeping is that the people involved in the activity engage in physical work in the open air, which has been coined the \\'green gym\\'. This paper will be useful to building designers of new and existing buildings who are looking for biodiversity credits as part of EcoHomes and BREEAM assessments, or whom are simply attempting to take a sustainable conscious approach to their design solutions by selecting appropriate vegetation to attract honey bees. Furthermore, it will demonstrate the importance of sustainable food production in the UK and the suitable sites in urban centres for beehives. \\xc2\\xa9 2006 RICS, The Bartlett School, UCL and the contributors First published.\"\\n\"Guiot S.R., Frigon J.-C.\",\"Anaerobic digestion as a sustainable solution for biosolids management in the pulp and paper sector\",2006,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-52649106406&partnerID=40&md5=c82c90ff52a3df3bc2803e01ea633882\",\"The Canadian Pulp and Paper industry is generating annually primary and secondary sludges in the range of 1.2 million dry tons (Mdt), out of which actually, about 52% are landfilled, 38% burned, 5% landspread, and 4% composted.

The implementation of green energy development, based on the use of biomass is in the right path in adopting a holistic approach in the promotion of renewable energy. Biomass is a form of clean and renewable energy that can help contribute towards mitigating greenhouse gases under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, while at the same time generating surplus energy needed by the world\\'s growing population. Malaysia has great potential for biomass energy utilisation, given its equatorial climate that is ideal for dense tropical forest growth and agricultural vegetation. Therefore, it is the aim of the Malaysian government to develop this sector, which in the long run can bring tremendous economic and environmental benefits. One sector that has been identified to have huge biomass energy potential is the oil palm sector. Being the largest producer of oil palm worldwide, Malaysia foresees a bright future in the development of biomass based renewable energy. In line with that, a study was conducted to determine the biomass energy potential of oil palm trees. Two prominent oil palm companies in Malaysia, Guthrie Berhad and Kuala Lumpur-Kepong Berhad were interviewed and taken as case studies. The above-ground biomass, such as palm trunk, fronds, empty fruit bunches (EFB), shell, fibre, etc were sampled and quantified. Sampling was carried out at oil palm plantations and mills, where direct mass measurements of oil palm wastes were made. With the mass, calorific, moisture content and ash content values, the oil palm waste components\\' energy potential was calculated. From the study, the total biomass energy potential for the sampled palm trees of ages 2, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 years were found to be 12.57, 109.10, 156.52, 185.52, 194.59 and 2232.25 MW/tree respectively. By converting their biomass wastes into useful energy, it not only allows oil palm companies to manage their wastes in a sustainable manner, but also helps generate electrical energy for use within the plantation and mill, and also to earn extra income with the sales of surplus electrical energy to the national grid. Additionally, they help protect the environment by mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. And with this, oil palm companies in Malaysia may look into participating in the CDM of the Kyoto Protocol and sell their carbon credits earned to developed nations. There is found to be great potential in this area in terms of energy, environmental and economic benefits, and it is definitely one that is worth exploring and developing.\"\\n\"Balan G., Luke S.\",\"History-based traffic control\",2006,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34247269704&doi=10.1145%2f1160633.1160743&partnerID=40&md5=bdb95cbd60c6838495b0e399ad12be0c\",\"What if traffic lights gave you a break after you\\'ve spent a long time waiting in traffic elsewhere?

Conventional cleaning processes (CCP), such as sorption, filtration, and disinfection, are combined with advanced treatment processes (ATP), such as photocatalyic oxidation to oxidize VOCs, air ionization to agglomerate PMx, and ultraviolet disinfection to inactivate bioaerosols. Modular hybrid devices for air cleaning are integrated into customized engineered systems. System controls and verifications of process performance are important for both air cleaning and energy conservation. Development of advanced technologies is supplemented by improved diagnostic techniques. Multi-parameter devices are available for continuous real-time monitoring of parameters. The LEED\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Rating System is a voluntary consensus-based national standard for developing high-performance, sustainable buildings. Credits are awarded for sustainable sites; water efficiency; energy &amp; atmosphere; materials &amp; resources; IEQ; and innovation &amp; design process. Managing IEQ is more than measurement of surrogates like carbon dioxide and \"\"opening a window\"\" for more \"\"fresh air\"\". IEQ management involves integrating smart designs and incorporating innovative controls. \"\"Dilution\"\" used to be \"\"the solution to pollution.\"\" \"\"Revolution\"\" is now \"\"the solution to indoor air pollution!\"\".\"\\n\"Burroughs H.E.B.\",\"Role of filtration and air cleaning in sustaining acceptable indoor environmental quality through ventilation air replacement - Phase I of a field study to establish characteristics of classes of air for ventilation air equivalency; document energy usage reductions; and demonstrate compliance to the IAQ method of standard 62.1\",2006,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34247146521&partnerID=40&md5=3f59f816f2fd1f57553ae434ad5dd903\",\"A number of concurrent trends are converging to invigorate the interest by designers and building owners in the usage of filtration and air cleaning (FAC) as an adjunct to the environmental conditioning of commercial and institutional buildings. These trends include the recent escalations of costs of energy in all forms; the heightened awareness by tenants and occupants about acceptable indoor air quality brought on by \"\"bad building\"\" publicity; the aging of the inventory of commercial buildings that were constructed to prior standards with deteriorating HVAC systems; recent numerous revisions and addenda to the ventilation standards and related unification of building codes; incentives such as green building/sustainability initiatives and potential energy related tax credits; and concerns about the protection of occupants from airborne chemical or biological contamination resulting from accidental or criminal sources. To provide designers, building owners and operators, code officials and regulators, with critical and lacking field performance data regarding FAC, a field study was performed of established installations of particulate and gas phase filtration. The research is planned to survey a significant number of sites in and around Atlanta, Georgia. The site population includes a variety of building types and usage, including high-rise hospitality; specialty museum; high-rise office; airport control tower; higher education laboratory/library; sports arena; conference center; and printing; The field study evaluated a full spectrum of airborne contaminants, including both inorganic and organic chemicals; metabolic gases; environmental conditions; and particulate matter. The study is undertaken in two Phases with the first being a screening Phase I to establish and finalize protocols and a second Phase II to replicate and fulfill the full scope of sites. This paper reports the preliminary data from Phase I, including characteristics of untreated outdoor air, as well as spaces treated with a variety of particulate filter MERV efficiency levels, as well as varied gas filtration media and filter styles. Thus, the data product of the field study is intended to establish the parameters of acceptable Class I dilution air compared with similar characteristics of air treated with a range of particulate and gas phase filtration. The study will document the comparable energy savings accrued as a result of the outdoor ventilation air reduction and also document significant control of contaminants of specific concerns regarding building security and occupant safety The results of the field study are intended to demonstrate to users of the ASHRAE Standard 62 Indoor Air Quality Method that FAC treated air can meet or exceed the anticipated quality level of outdoor dilution air. These data will also a valuable information resource for standards writing bodies and code officials who are faced with the converging needs for assuring sustained or enhanced indoor environmental quality while reducing energy demand.\"\\n\"Fusaro P.\",\"Policymakers must create uniform green trading rules\",2006,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33846256666&partnerID=40&md5=9da1575bcffcdec58a56af5b4244ebec\",\"This presentation will focus on both the status of the markets but also the market drivers for the increased level of interest in emissions trading as it becomes a serious corporate financial issue. It will focus on insights on what to look for in the emerging portfolio approach of companies to manage their environment financial risk management through trading. Environmental financial markets in 2005 are accelerating their market maturation process for SO2, NOX, and carbon dioxide. They are also being driven by regulatory changes, increased coal burning, higher prices and more volatility for fossil fuels, and a knock effect from the launch of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme for carbon dioxide and the five other greenhouse gases. These markets have now brought in more corporate and trading players due to the growing awareness that emissions trading markets work. Factors influencing present market developments include (a) the more stringent air quality standards and the increased coal burn have brought sulfur dioxide credits to the highest level ever in recent months. The ratcheting up of environmental regulations through 2015 promise to drive technology changes and increased trading activity for SO2, (b) increased severity and tight deadlines to reduce NOX emissions for industry in many regions of the country including the Houston Galveston area by 2008, and the (c) the continued interest in carbon dioxide trading in the US driven by the increased trading volumes on the Chicago Climate Exchange as well as the implementation of the EU ETS on January 1, 2005.\"\\n\"Smith J.S., Aggarwal V., Fine S., Smith J., Goldstein R.\",\"Landfill gas to electricity projects: A cost effective energy solution\",2006,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33846211043&partnerID=40&md5=26297651c094e6745fee7acb1db9d650\",\"Demand for renewable energy is growing rapidly and landfill gas (LFG) is considered an established, low-cost, reliable source of renewable power. LFG energy can be used to satisfy renewable portfolio standards as well as support consumer renewable power products. As a renewable resource, LFG provides both environmental as well as economic benefits. It is one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy on a levelized cost basis and as a baseload renewable, also provides full credit against reserve margins. Because it is one of the few renewables that reduces methane and NMOC emissions, it also has the potential to provide additional emissions credits from methane reductions at the landfill apart from the green attributes received from offset of grid electricity. Landfill gas based electricity projects have a proven track record of nearly 25 years and currently the installed capacity adds up to over 1,000 MW with individual projects as large as 50 MW. There are several financial and regulatory incentives available for LFGE projects at the state and federal level including the Section 45 tax credits that were recently reinstated as part of the corporate tax bill.

However, the cost and approval process for a landfill gas (LFG) to energy project can be daunting. Based on the experience of the 250 LFG burning electric projects and other landfill gas projects in planning in the US, these relatively small, electric facilities are often riskier ventures and more marginally profitable than fossil fuel utility stations. This presentation will describe how the quality of LFG and its contaminants pose special permitting challenges for LFG to energy projects and how project proponents have addressed Federal air permit requirements; state and local emission and toxics programs; and energy industry requirements and regulations. Examples will show how permitting challenges and grid connection costs can force these small electric projects, often 1-4 MW, into on-site use or direct use in boilers. LFG energy projects may be setting precedents for approvals of other bio-fuel efforts as well. Because gas production tax credits are unlikely to be available for LFG in the future, strong support from the green credit programs may be needed for LFG electricity production to continue to grow and contribute to the renewable energy portfolios.\"\\n\"Hollinger A.N., Rajkovich N.\",\"An evaluation of two residential green building programs: Leed for homes and the Solar Decathlon\",2006,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33845796177&partnerID=40&md5=c1989f61ec0f6a35a3a09bf9a4c5a04b\",\"In the Fall of 2005, the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) released the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) for Homes program.

The expanding role of these economic \"\"teleconnections\"\" (coupled phenomena that take place in distant places on the planet) led to a 3-year period (2002-2004) of historically high deforestation rates. But it also increases the potential for large-scale conservation in the region as markets and finance institutions demand better environmental and social performance of beef and soy producers. Cattle ranchers and soy farmers who have generally opposed ambitious government regulations that require forest reserves on private property are realizing that good land stewardship - including compliance with legislation - may increase their access to expanding domestic and international markets and to credit and lower the risk of \"\"losing\"\" their land to agrarian reform. The realization of this potential depends on the successful negotiation of social and environmental performance criteria and an associated system of certification that are acceptable to both the industries and civil society.

A market is emerging in carbon, providing opportunities for cost-effective management of a business\\'s carbon assets and liabilities. Emission Reduction Units (ERUs) can be generated through Joint Implementation (JI) projects in so-called Annex 1 nations (covering the former Soviet Union.

In order to attain the national target for PV capacity in 2010, photovoltaics need more expensive buy-back than in the present, but after 2010 the necessary buy-back decreases gradually. If 120 JPY/W PV system sales price is attained by 2030, photovoltaics become cost-competitive without any supports. Subsidy through buy-back becomes almost unnecessary in 2030, if we can reduce it to less than 170 JPY/W. The total necessary buy-back reaches a peak in 2025. It is much more than ongoing subsidy to capital cost of PV systems, but annual revenue from the assumed carbon tax can finance the annual total necessary buy-back. This means that if photovoltaics can attain the targeted PV systems sales price, we should support it for a while by spending carbon tax revenue effectively and efficiently. \\xc2\\xa9 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\"\\n[No author name available],\"FCE reduces energy costs for onion processing plant, jail\",2006,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030596832&doi=10.1016%2fS1464-2859%2806%2971175-0&partnerID=40&md5=7cef036091fddb419a8a7eb08e00dd92\",\"Gills Onions, a grower and processor of fresh-cut onions in California, has purchased two Direct FuelCell DFC 300MA power plants from FCE, and will reduce its energy costs by using biogas to generate electricity. Meanwhile, a 1 Mw plant from FCE is being used to generate electricity for Santa Rita Jail in Alameda County, CA, making it the greenest county facility in the US. According to David and Steven Gill, owners of Gills Onions, they have achieved tremendous efficiencies by using technology to streamline the process of cleaning, cutting, packaging, and selling fresh produce. The latter has focused his attention on boosting the firms energy reliability and efficiency while reducing energy costs by installing two 250 kw DFC units, which are expected to be operational in mid-2007. By using renewable biogas, generated by digesting onion peel and other fresh produce waste, Gills Onions will reduce its fuel and waste disposal costs, resulting in significant annual savings. Gills Onions will be able to depreciate the capital cost of the fuel cell on an accelerated 5-yr schedule, and take advantage of an Investment Tax Credit for the purchase of fuel cell power plants. The Santa Rita Jail project will provide 50% of the facilitys annual power needs, save county taxpayers more than $260 000/yr, and benefit the environment. The installation of the plant is Alameda Countys latest accomplishment in its Climate Change Leadership Strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The power from the new unit, i.e., a DFC 1500 fuel cell system, along with the jails previously installed 1.2 Mw solar power array and energy efficiency upgrades, will shrink its power purchases by as much as 80% during the peak-demand summer months, when California\\'s electric utility grid can face capacity constraints. This lower demand will also eliminate > 3200 ton/yr of greenhouse gas emissions.\"\\n\"Haselbach L.M., Bruner S.U.\",\"Determining construction debris recycling dumpster densities\",2006,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77953197267&doi=10.3992%2fjgb.1.3.139&partnerID=40&md5=1b5c7bd18b2f2533e3489ab174ae82ca\",\"Solid waste generated by construction and demolition (C&amp;D) projects account for a significant portion of solid waste generated and landfilled in the United States.

The hypothesis is that if an individual\\'s selfish incentive can be made to align more with the socially optimal objective, then the creative energy of individuals\\' diversity would become more unified in achieving the social objective. The key is to make that incentive market-based and monetary in nature This paper will first outline the concept of UDI-ism and discuss how it will benefit the economy in general It will then apply this concept to the problem of global warming and show how it will enable market principles to manage the effect of CO2 emitted by the electricity sector. Instead of using a CO2 tax to penalize power production sources which emit CO2, this approach considers air as the common asset of all human inhabitants of the Earth. The price of CO2 is a means for the collection of money paid by electricity consumers into a trust fund That trust fund is owned jointly by residents of a country or a region. That money is managed and used for environment benefits according to the wish of the residents This method is more effective than tax credits or other tax incentives to promote green technologies, because it is a market method Preliminary analysis in this paper shows that this method can significantly reduce the global CO2 emissions without increasing the cost of electricity by an unreasonable amount. With the effect of CO2 on global warming becoming more urgent, this method may offer the best solution for the most effective way to solve the problem With the power system as an example application, it is hoped that this paper will stimulate discussions among researchers to further explore these ideas so that a more robust and more optimal economic system will become reality. \\xc2\\xa9 2006 IEEE.\"\\n\"Kumar A., Flynn P., Sokhansanj S.\",\"Biopower generation in British Columbia: An opportunity for greenhouse gas mitigation\",2006,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-41549165158&doi=10.1109%2fEICCCC.2006.277181&partnerID=40&md5=3c2bb719ee822af3d1ad35e5385d9e41\",\"Biomass is considered carbon neutral, and replacement of fossil fuel based power by biomass based power could significantly help mitigate greenhouse gases. Large areas of forests in British Columbia (B.C.) are being infested by the Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB). Dead wood from MPB infestation of B.C.\\'s forest is expected to vastly exceed the ability of the pulp and lumber industry to utilize it; current estimates are that 200 to 600 million eu. m of wood will remain unharvested over the next 20 years. Regions where the damaged wood is not harvested will experience loss of jobs in the forestry sector, increased risk of forest fire hazard, carbon emissions from burned or decaying wood, and uncertainty about timing of replanting since this usually occurs at harvest. This paper report the results of a detailed preliminary techno-economic analysis of producing power from MPB killed wood. Power plant size and location are critical factors affecting overall power cost. Overall cost of power rises steeply at sizes below 300 MW net power output. By locating the power plant in an area of high Infestation, transportation distances can be minimized. A 300 MW power plant would consume 64 million eu. m of wood over a 20 year lifetime, and hence is a significant sink for otherwise unharvestable wood. Cost estimates are based on harvesting of whole dead trees with roadside chipping and transport to a central power plant located in either the Nazko or Quesnel regions of B.C. A circulating fluidized bed boiler with a conventional steam cycle is a currently available technology demonstrated In Finland. The estimated power cost is S68 to $74 per MWh, which is competitive with other \"\"green power\"\" values in B.C. Given recent values of export power in the Pacific Northwest, a 300 MW MPB power plant can compete with a carbon credit below $15 per tonne of CO2. \\xc2\\xa9 2006 IEEE.\"\\n\"Pereira O.S., Reis T.M., De Ara\\xc3\\xbajo R.G.B., Gon\\xc3\\xa7alves F.F.\",\"Renewable energy as a tool to assure continuity of low emissions in the Brazilian electric power sector\",2006,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-41549120556&doi=10.1109%2fEICCCC.2006.277208&partnerID=40&md5=3c3e715a3518c6a5821ca04ca86c86fd\",\"In the Brazilian Electric Sector more than 80% of its installed capacity is based on hydro and biomass energy. A new legal framework has imposed roles for renewable sources of energy, establishing that 10% of electric power must come from these sources over the next twenty years. Historically, hydro power has been the key source of electricity in Brazil. In spite of this, due to restructuring of the sector during the nineties, both natural gas and nuclear energy have become increasingly significant sources. Coal is still widely utilized in the southern part of the country. However, due to its predominately hydro nature, the system\\'s operation is centralized and its dispatching optimized, with hydro and nuclear energy as low - cost/must - run sources, and natural gas and coal, which because of some local electrical inflexibilities and being more expensive fall into second place behind the must run sources. In April 2002, Brazilian Congress approved a law which created a stick and carrot policy to put the development of renewable energy (wind, biomass and small hydro) on the national agenda. The established policy was to be carried out in two phases, with the compulsory purchase by Eletrobr\\xc3\\xa1s of 3,300 MW of these sources up to 2006, and another additional 15% of the market annual expansion, with the goal of reaching 10% of the market supplied by those three sources in 20 years. At the same time, a levy on tariffs was also created with the same law, to allow Eletrobr\\xc3\\xa1s to cover the difference between the generation costs of competitive sources and the costs of these new sources During 2004 and 2005 the law was regulated by electricity regulatory agency and the federal government established different cap prices for each technology. Several regulations were passed and an auction in two phases was implemented in order to reach the designated goal of 3,300 MW. Mandatory dispatching of energy from these sources was included in the contracts, assuring it to be dispatched whenever it is available, so displacing thermal plants with higher operating marginal costs. Following the auction, 144 projects were contracted and the estimated energy was around 13,500 GWh. Projects were proportionately distributed among geographical regions. The bulk of the projects were able to avoid the emission of 2.8 million tonnes CO2 per year, since due to technical characteristics and legal definitions, all of them are must run sources, avoiding the necessity to dispatch any thermal energy. These preliminary estimates of CO2 reduction, based on Approved Consolidated Methodology 002 (UNFCCC), can produce, in terms of carbon credits, between 10 to 15% in the volume of the required subsidy introduced by the previously mentioned law. \\xc2\\xa9 2006 IEEE.\"\\n\"Bogen A.\",\"Do as i do\",2006,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-36148958575&doi=10.2495%2fEEIA060141&partnerID=40&md5=96a2fcbcb595149da473a1517b110ca6\",\"The Brownfields program has often served as a laboratory for technology and process innovation.

Depleted soil organic C (SOC) pools of reclaimed mine soil (RMS) ecosystems can be restored through conversion to an appropriate land use and adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs). The objectives of this paper are to (1) synthesize available information on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from coal mining and combustion activities, (2) understand mechanisms of SOC sequestration and its protection, (3) identify factors affecting C sequestration potential in RMSs, (4) review available methods for the estimation of ecosystem C budget (ECB), and (5) identify knowledge gaps to enhance C sink capacity of RMS ecosystems and prioritize research issues. The drastic perturbations of soil by mining activities can accentuate CO2 emission through mineralization, erosion, leaching, changes in soil moisture and temperature regimes, and reduction in biomass returned to the soil. The reclamation of drastically disturbed soils leads to improvement in soil quality and development of soil pedogenic processes accruing the benefit of SOC sequestration and additional income from trading SOC credits. The SOC sequestration potential in RMS depends on amount of biomass production and return to soil, and mechanisms of C protection. The rate of SOC sequestration ranges from 0.1 to 3.1\\xc2\\xa0Mg ha- 1 yr- 1 and 0.7 to 4\\xc2\\xa0Mg ha- 1 yr- 1 in grass and forest RMS ecosystem, respectively. Proper land restoration alone could off-set 16\\xc2\\xa0Tg CO2 in the U.S. annually. However, the factors affecting C sequestration and protection in RMS leading to increase in microbial activity, nutrient availability, soil aggregation, C build up, and soil profile development must be better understood in order to formulate guidelines for development of an holistic approach to sustainable management of these ecosystems. The ECBs of RMS ecosystems are not well understood. An ecosystem method of evaluating ECB of RMS ecosystems is proposed. \\xc2\\xa9 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

These mechanisms would seem to offer some efficiency and flexibility advantages over more traditional regulatory approaches, while being highly compatible with competitive market-based electricity industries. Australia has been an early and enthusiastic adopter of both electricity industry restructuring and market-based environmental instruments. This paper first outlines some of these recent policy developments. In particular, we describe the objectives, design and outcomes to date of electricity industry restructuring, the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target, the NSW Greenhouse Benchmarks, the Queensland 13% Gas scheme and Government accredited Green Power. From this, we draw some key design lessons for such market-based instruments. These include the perils of abstraction in scheme design, the vital importance of setting appropriate baselines in \\'baseline and credit\\' schemes, the possibility that such measures may interact in ways that reduce their environmental effectiveness, \\'market for lemon\\' risks with tradable instruments that have measurement, verification or \\'additionality\\' difficulties, and the challenges of creating transparent liquid markets for these mechanisms. The mixed performance of these Australian schemes to date illustrates the need for great care in designing such market-based approaches. \\xc2\\xa9 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

For these markets to grow, there need to be price indices and common, consistent metrics that are applicable across market segments of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction, renewable energy, and energy efficiency. Finally, the chapter discusses the role of exchanges and the creation of the global CO2 emissions portfolio. Emissions rights may be traded through bilateral transactions or brokerage houses or by listing on exchanges. The Kyoto Protocol envisions three international mechanisms-emissions trading, joint implementation (JI), and clean development mechanism (CDM)-that enable Annex 1 countries to reach emissions-reduction targets beginning in 2008 through 2012. The U.S. has already established an over-the-counter (OTC) market for NOx and has traded CO2 emissions. Another emerging financial trend that may hold the key to GHG emissions liquidity is the structured finance market, that is, \"\"Green Finance.\"\" The global market that now seems best positioned for trading is the renewable energy credit (REG) market. As initially proposed by the Environmental Defense Fund (a U.S. environmental organization now called Environmental Defense) to the first Bush administration for the trading of SO2 credits, the emissions-trading market has been successful even beyond what its architects envisioned. Basically, during March of each year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) runs an emissions auction supervised by the Chicago Board of Trade. Having seen the emergence and maturation of oil, gas, power, weather, and coal as fungible commodity trading markets, the environment is now well positioned to be the next financial commodity trading market. Green trading promises to be a $3 trillion commodity market involving major energy company participation. \\xc2\\xa9 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This undeveloped property is known as the Greens Bayou Wetlands Mitigation Bank (bank). A portion of the bank, known as Subdivision A, currently has wetlands mitigation banking credits available. Subdivision A, created in 1997, is a forested wetland with shallow ponds and meandering swales. Public and private entities within Harris County can, upon receipt of a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit, purchase credits within the bank to compensate for unavoidable impacts to jurisdictional waters of the U.S. By matching federal grant monies administered through the Texas Department of Transportation, HCFCD was able to design and construct an 89 hectare (220 acre) wetland urban stormwater treatment facility within the bank in 1999. The facility, known as Subdivision B, captures and treats runoff from an approximately 36 hectare (90 acre) watershed of Beltway 8. Previously, this runoff was discharged untreated directly into Greens Bayou. The treated stormwater is used as a hydrology source for created wetland habitats. Both the stormwater treatment train and created wetland habitats will be used as wetland mitigation credits within the bank. This concept of using a stormwater treatment facility as a wetlands mitigation bank is unique to the area. A WET 2.0 assessment program is utilized to determine the functions and values of the wetlands located on the debtor site. The cost of mitigation at the bank is a fixed price per acre regardless of the number of debits the impact site generates based on the WET 2.0 assessment. This allows potential permit applicants to calculate mitigation costs early in the planning phase of a project. The permit applicant is not typically involved in the WET 2.0 process or discussion between the agencies regarding removal of debits from the bank.\"\\n\"Azerbegi R., Bradburn J.\",\"2005 solar world congress: Sustainable design, leed , and the rawlins field office\",2005,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84870491533&partnerID=40&md5=b2e59913f3347ce53321e3d67f49f6ab\",\"The U.S. Green Building Council s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System was used to assess the sustainability of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management s Rawlins Field Office Building.

For this analysis, the energy system of Japan is modeled using MARKAL, which is one of the energy system model based on multi-objective linear programming. With national PV capacity targets in mind and an assumed carbon tax, PV system sales price and electricity buy-back rates necessary to make PV cost-competitive with other energy technologies is estimated. The results show that, under the expected carbon tax of 6000 JPY/t-C, PV require continuous subsidies via buy-backs even if both fuel savings and green credit are taken into account. Annual revenue of the assumed carbon tax is sufficient to finance the estimated total annual subsidy. Estimated cost-effectiveness of the subsidy ranges from about 33000 JPY/t-C in around 2020 to zero in 2030. It is anticipated that the analysis will provide decision making support for prioritizing and optimizing subsidies to new energy technologies. \\xc2\\xa9 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This is a fundamental benefit of Low Impact Design (LID). Recent monitoring studies have shown that the reductions in runoff volumes and peak flows using LID can be substantial. However, there are still serious deficiencies in realistic LID design approaches, let alone the monitoring and verification of such approaches. It is remarkable just how much effort in setting standards and criteria for RMP design is based upon incomplete, and sometimes faulty, science. Even the more advanced statewide BMP (\"\"Best\"\" Management Practice) manuals allocate specific reduction efficiencies to RMPs, and/or allocate a supposedly precise \"\"point system\"\" to certain RMP designs, methods that only attempt to characterize just how well these designs would really work.

Results show that a positive net present value can be achieved in the buffer by harvesting 50 percent of the timber volume and selling half as veneer logs. Net present value was slightly negative when only one third of the harvestable timber was sold. Harvest and sale of only pulpwood was not found to be profitable. Achieving a positive net return depended greatly on harvest volume. How much timber volume can be removed from a buffer without jeopardizing its water protection function is currently unknown in western Washington. Poplar wood production returns are comparable to lower-end local crops such as hay and green peas. Environmental credits, such as carbon, water quality and habitat credits are potential future sources of income from riparian buffers. The use of alternative species and extension of the harvest age are also potential means of enhancing buffer net income on smaller acreages.\"\\n\"Kemp S.\",\"Investigations of the consumer psychology of near-money\",2005,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33645558116&doi=10.1007%2f0-387-25004-2_14&partnerID=40&md5=5716ac1e23d2be0de28a282a9245aa07\",\"Polanyi (1957, p. 266) remarked that early forms of money were \"\"special purpose money\"\". Different kinds of objects are employed in the different money uses, and the uses are instituted independently of each other.\"\" Modem societies in contrast (eg Belk, 1999, Lea, Tarpy & Webley, 1987) have general all-purpose money which can be used to purchase a vast variety of goods and services and which is widely accepted throughout a society. Yet, modem industrialised societies do also have equivalents of primitive money, currencies which are restricted in use and which may be thought of as \"\"near-money\"\" (Lea et al., 1987, p. 328). One of the more widespread of these near-moneys is frequent flyer mileage. Frequent flyer schemes are operated at present by many airlines throughout the world. They are often conceived as an attempt to increase sales by rewarding customer loyalty (although whether they are an effective way to do this is questionable, eg, Ehrenberg and Scriven, 1999). In essence, customers eam frequent flyer miles by flying with a particular airline (and sometimes by using other services). The frequent flyer miles may then be exchanged for free flights on the airline, class upgrades, and other, usually travel-related, services. The rules governing frequent flyer schemes are often complex and vary somewhat from airline to airline but usually the miles or airpoints cannot be simply bought or sold for cash and, indeed, the cost structure under which flights are bought with these miles may be different from the cost structure that is offered for cash payment. For example, under the Air New Zealand scheme operating in March 2003, return flights to a destination cost the same airpoints as one-way flights. Another example of a near-money is given by \"\"faux currencies\"\" (Sin, 2002) issued to facilitate commerce within networks of different firms. Such currencies may be used by member firms to purchase a wide variety of goods and services from other member firms. Bartercard is one such company, operating in New Zealand and elsewhere, that has created its own currency (known as trade dollars). Credit in this currency is extended to firms (usually small) that become members of Bartercard. These trade dollars may be spent on goods and services provided by other member firms and in turn the firm is expected to honour trade dollars offered by other firms in exchanges for its own goods and services. A percentage of each transaction must be paid to Bartercard in legal tender (NZ dollars). Transactions in New Zealand are also liable to Goods and Services Tax which also must be paid in legal tender. An economic analysis of Bartercard is given by Sin (2002). Although clearly there are differences between trade dollars and frequent flyer miles, there are also points of similarity. The Bartercard network, for example, does not cover all goods and services within the economy, although it covers a wider range than frequent flyer schemes. It also resembles frequent flyer schemes in trying to encourage customer loyalty, although over a wider range of firms and products. As Sin (2002, p. 3) puts it, the scheme \"\"seeks to induce greater trade between member firms and individuals by constraining a proportion of their incomes to be spent on the products and services of other members.\"\" It is worth noting that although frequent flyer miles and the trade dollars described above are issued by single commercial firms, it is also quite common for near-money to be issued by non-profit organisations and other networks. A common example within New Zealand is the use of \"\"Green Dollars\"\" (eg Invercargill Barter and Exchange Systems (Green Dollars), 2003). The LETS (Local Exchange and Trading Scheme) system (Linton & Soutar, 1994) seems particularly widespread, and has been the subject of a number of evaluations. Such evaluations have considered, for example, the scheme\\'s potential to help the unemployed to gain employment or to become self-employed (Peacock, 2000, Williams, 200 I), its potential for encouraging innovation (O\\'Doherty, 1999), and its offer of an alternative to global trading networks (Carmen, 1997). Both trade dollars and frequent flyer miles seem subject to inflationary pressure, It has been remarked that worldwide there are large holdings of frequent flyer miles which may prove difficult to redeem (eg Briggs, 2002). The problem with trade dollars is more subtle but Bartercard managers acknowledge that it is possible for some firms to receive more trade dollars than they can easily spend. Perhaps crucial here is that the balance of supply and demand of the different goods and services within the Bartercard network is not determined by a market mechanism but rather by the attempts of the Bartercard management to balance out the different demands. So, for example, an accountant would generally not be permitted to join the network if there were already a number of accountants within the network and the demand for their services from other members was small. The studies reported below focus on aspects of the way near-money is perceived. An obvious point of interest is the valuation put on near-money. As there is no real market for either trade dollars or frequent flyer miles (since the managing companies generally do not permit them to be transferred), respondents were asked what they would be willing to pay for near-money and what they would be willing to sell nearmoney for if such transactions were permitted. A number of hypotheses about such transactions were made. Firstly, and most obviously, one would expect a good deal of variability in individual valuations, simply because there is no market. Secondly, because Bartercard (and other) trade dollars can only be spent on a smaller range of goods and services than legal tender, they might usually be valued at less than legal tender. Thirdly, and perhaps more subtly, one might anticipate a gap between what people would be willing to pay for near-money and what they would be willing to sell it for. This expectation arises because a number of studies have shown that people often ask more to part with goods than they would pay to acquire them (eg Kahneman, Knetsch & Thaler, 199 I). Thus, for example, respondents are often willing to pay less for environmental goods than they are willing to accept to give them up (eg Hammack & Brown, 1974, Rowe, d\\'Arge & Brookshire, 1980), and students ask more to surrender Cornell coffee mugs or chocolate bars they have been given than they would pay to acquire them (Kahneman, Knetsch & Thaler, 1990, Knetsch, 1989). A similar result has been found to hold for the buying and selling of lotteries (eg Borges & Knetsch, 1998, Knetsch & Sinden, 1984), but when Kahneman et al. (1990) established a market in \"\"induced value tokens\"\" there was no appreciable difference between the buying and selling prices of the tokens. Other kinds of hypotheses about near-money can be made. One might anticipate that people and firms who are members of Bartercard and similar organisations would experience difficulties in disposing of their trade dollars. This follows because many goods and services (eg electricity) cannot be bought from other members. Thus, in accordance with Gresham\\'s Law, one might expect that people would generally prefer to be paid in legal tender but spend trade dollars. Similarly, if people have difficulty in spending trade dollars, one could expect low levels of satisfaction with the organisation as a whole. Three studies are reported below. In the first, members of both Bartercard and a similar, smaller rival, Tradecard, were questioned about some of their experiences and asked to value their trade dollars. In Study 2 a sample of Bartercard members were questioned about how they spent their trade dollars and again asked to value them. In Study 3, members and non-members of frequent flyer schemes were asked to value frequent flyer miles. \\xc2\\xa9 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.\"\\n\"Sarkis J., Tamarkin M.\",\"A quadranomial real options model for evaluation of emissions trading and technology\",2005,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33644612024&doi=10.1117%2f12.631775&partnerID=40&md5=17517c2adf64005fba34258ae1535e67\",\"Green house gas (GHG) emissions have been tied to global climate change. One popular policy instrument that seems to have gained credibility with explicit mention of its application in the Kyoto Protocol is the use of permit trading and cap-and-trade mechanisms. Organizations functioning within this environment will need to manage their resources appropriately to remain competitive. Organizations will either have the opportunity to purchase emissions credits (offsets) from a market trading scheme or seek to reduce their emissions through different measures. Some measures may include investment in new technologies that will reduce their reliance on GHG emitting practices. In many countries, large organizations and institutions generate their own power to operate their facilities. Much of this power is generated (or bought) from GHG producing technology. Specific renewable energy sources such as wind and solar photovoltaic technology may become more feasible alternatives available to a large percentage of these organizations if they are able to take advantage and incorporate the market for GHG emissions trading in their analyses. To help organizations evaluate investment in these renewable energy technologies we introduce a real options based model that will take into consideration uncertainties associated with the technology and those associated with the GHG trading market. The real options analysis will consider both the stochastic (uncertainty) nature of the exercise price of the technology and the stochastic nature of the market trading price of the GHG emissions.\"\\n\"Jockyman A.\",\"Green Bureaucracy: Elevated cost and delay in dealing with processes postpone approval of company projects that seek carbon credit benefits [Burdcracia verde: Custo elevado e demora na tramita\\xc3\\xa7\\xc3\\xa3o de processos retarda aprova\\xc3\\xa7\\xc3\\xa3o de projetos de empresas que buscam benef\\xc3\\xadcios do cr\\xc3\\xa9dito de carbono]\",2005,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-31644446798&partnerID=40&md5=be28cb07385411b368eacd369680b131\",[No abstract available]\\n\"Nair G.P.\",\"Use of barrier systems to reduce hydrosulphite requirements in continuous pad-steam vat dyeing part 1: Liquid systems\",2005,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-30744463748&partnerID=40&md5=8640284e97f9f58d095dcc53a46dd59b\",\"The first article on this subject in this series, viz., Sci-Tech 52[1] was on detailed studies of the decomposition of sodium hydrosulphite in chemical pad liquor of continuous pad-steam vat dyeing, highlighting the need to check this by using partial substitutes.

This paper examines how many farmers have increased their productivity with more intensive cropping systems of fruit, vegetables, and in some cases, flowers. Total area under these crops more than tripled between 1977 and 2003. Case studies to highlight the transformation include vegetable production to feed Asia\\'s booming cities, diversification of export crops in Thailand, vegetable production in Malaysia\\'s Cameron Highlands, flower production in Yunnan Province of China and opium replacement in the Golden Triangle. Access to the market is necessary for transformation, but changes are also driven by farmers\\' own innovations combined with contributions from last century\\'s crop science, from phytohormones to hybrid technology. Other inputs are irrigation, fertilizers and pesticides, with overuse of the last two a serious threat to the environment as well as to human health. Concerns have also been raised regarding soil erosion caused by cropping on steep slopes. In addition to building roads and airports, government support has also come in the form of cheap credit for orchard establishment and more efficient quarantine procedures to facilitate exports. Cross-border trade that brings opportunities to inaccessible border regions will be further enhanced by regional free trade policy, particularly when liberalization of trade in fruit and vegetables is specified such as that just signed by ASEAN and China. Finally, a case is made for the need to improve cropping systems in less favorable environment with limited access to the market and the means through which crop scientists can work with farmers to bring this about.\"\\n[No author name available],\"Industry news: Winds of change stirring in Colorado\",2005,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-24944489946&partnerID=40&md5=78e03ed4ccfc0a16d6b0056eaa2ca9f5\",\"Senator Lamar Alexander came under criticism from a small Colorado town for his proposed bill denying tax credits to some wind turbines.

Does this imply redlining does not take place elsewhere? This paper presents evidence from Rotterdam, the second largest city of the Netherlands, showing that in the 1990s it was impossible to get a home mortgage in large parts of the city. However, after Rotterdam joined the National Mortgage Guarantee (an institutional control measure) in 2000, hardly any evidence of redlining was found. This paper not only shows that redlining takes place outside of the US context, but also that a (discursive) treatment based on case study research has the possibility to gain a fuller understanding of redlining practices than a statistical/ correlation analysis of mortgage data. Interviews with key actors are instrumental to unravelling how, why and when those in power make their decisions: agents are structured by the existing system while, at the same time, some of these agents have the power to re-produce as well as re-structure (transform) the system. One of the geographical outcomes of the agency-structure interaction is that credit is \"\"redirected away from poorer to richer (and therefore \"\"safer\"\") groups\"\" as part of a strategy of risk avoidance [Leyshon and Thrift, 1997]. Thus redlining, like any other form of financial exclusion, deepens and accentuates prevailing levels of uneven development by creating geographical variations in access to the financial system [Dymski and Veitch, 1992]. \\xc2\\xa9 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In the near-term, cofiring of the feedstock-in combination with other woody biomass-with coal in existing utility power boilers is considered to be the most promising conversion method for energy generation. Despite the clear technological viability and associated environmental benefits, cofiring of willow has not been widely adopted. The relatively high production cost of the willow feedstock, which is over twice that of coal, is the primary reason for this lack of interest. Taxes that account for some of the social costs of using coal and/or incentives that appropriate value for some of the social benefits of using willow are essential for eliminating most or the entire current price differential. This paper presents an integrated analysis of the economics of power generation from cofiring willow biomass feedstock with coal, from the perspective of the grower, aggregator and the power plant. Emphasis is placed on analyzing the relative impact of a green premium price, a closed-loop biomass tax credit, and payments to growers under the proposed Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) harvesting exemption policy. The CRP payments reduced the delivered cost of willow by 36-35%, to $ 1.90 GJ-1 and $ 1.70 GJ-1, under current and increased yield conditions, respectively. These prices are still high, relative to coal. Other incentives are required to ensure commercial viability. The required levels of green premium price (0.4-1.0 cents kWh-1) and biomass tax credit (0.75-2.4 cents kWh-1) vary depending on whether the incentives were being applied by themselves or in combination, and whether current yield or potential increased yields were being considered. In the near term, cofiring willow biomass and coal can be an economically viable option for power generation in NY if the expected overall beneficial effects associated with the production and use of the biomass is accounted for. \\xc2\\xa9 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The physical aspects of this project are described, and a breakdown cost methodology is proposed in order to estimate the main financial determinants of the integrated EOR with CO2 sequestration (cost of capture, compression, transportation and storage). Project evaluation is derived from a cash flow model, regarding reservoir production profile, price and costs, capital expenditures (CAPEX), operating expenditures (OPEX), carbon credits, depreciation time, fiscal assumptions, etc. A sensitivity analysis study was carried out in order to identify the most critical variables. Results indicate that project NPV is around US$ 3.2 million, what is significant for a small mature field.

New Mexico is now experiencing the benefits of renewable energy, with more than 200 MW being installed by the end of 2003. New Mexico has even entered the marketplace with wind power crossing the borders of ERCOT in a daring bid to power the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\\'s (EPA) own laboratory in Houston with Green-e tagged blocks of renewable energy from Clovis, NM. Oklahoma will install more than 175 MW, finally opening its door to what could be a most notable crossroads in wind power development. Now, overlay major environmental issues of another kind in water pollution and air pollution issues in rural and metropolitan areas coupled with changes in the national emissions inventory. The effect is that three new target areas come in the picture. These are concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO) with new rules as of March 2003, publicly owned treatment works (POTW) who must now report emissions in more detail, and municipal solid waste landfills (MSW-LF) with the 2004 changes in landfill design of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbioreactors.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d These older facilities create more than 500 million tons of manure, more than 110 million tons of municipal solid waste and more than 50 million tons of human waste for treatment.

The logistics are straight forward, and management in the industry does not always understand needs and methodology that must be followed to be a successful.

It accounts for about one-fourth (25 per cent) of the gross domestic product (GDP) and is the source of livelihood for nearly two-thirds (60 per cent) of the population. The green revolution has been the cornerstone of India\\'s agricultural achievement, transforming the country from one of food deficiency to self-sufficiency through enhanced technology adoption, increased public and private investments and certain institutional innovations that have augmented production and productivity gains. The post-green revolution period has witnessed impressive structural changes (Vyas, 2004) taking place in Indian agriculture. For example, Indian agriculture has been progressively acquiring the small farm character, with 40 per cent of the land now being operated by small and marginal farmers. The output mix in Indian agriculture has also undergone a significant shift from foodgrains to non-foodgrains and within foodgrains from coarse to finer cereals. Use of high-end inputs such as fertilisers, insecticides, improved seeds, mechanical farm implements, etc., have raised the proportion of inputs and consequently the total outlay on inputs. Despite impressive growth performance, the agriculture sector in India continues to be inefficient and plagued by constraints resulting in sluggish farm sector growth. The present paper attempts to spell out some of the constraints like, stagnancy in production and factor productivity growth, inadequate institutional support, migration of agricultural labour, etc. It also seeks to highlight some of the major areas of concerns facing Indian agriculture: Land Market and Use, Agriculture Labour - Rural Unemployment and Poverty, Capital Formation and Investment, Agriculture Inputs-Supply and Availability, Agriculture Credit - Extent of and Access to Institutional Credit and Agriculture Extension Network.\"\\n\"Fusaro P.C.\",\"What is green trading?\",2005,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-17444402915&doi=10.1016%2fS1471-0846%2805%2900334-3&partnerID=40&md5=110cf488a0886db5d725f8e2b6eb5fd4\",\"An overview of Green Trading, its benefits and its role in making a more cleaner environment is discussed.

Many proponents of sustainable energy anticipate that electric generation from renewable sources would thrive in a deregulated market, driven by consumer demand for \"\"green\"\" energy and the end of incentives to build large central power plants under the cost-plus profits guaranteed by state utility commissions. This paper examines the flaws in this expectation. After reviewing the highly cyclical nature of U.S. energy policy making in recent decades, the study links the ineffectiveness of policy with the institutional setting. Under electric utility market restructuring, renewable energy generation (wind, biomass, solar, geothermal, and small-scale hydro) must overcome barriers such as price distortions, lack of storage capability, discriminatory transmission system access, and the end of linked utility rate hikes guaranteed to cover the additional expense of renewable generation. In the absence of strong federal leadership, the state commitment to renewable energy has been uneven under utility restructuring. Moreover, nuclear power - the other leading alternative to fossil fuel use - is beset by serious problems. Only renewable energy options offer long-term hope for sustainability. Along these lines, green marketing, renewable portfolio standards, system benefit charges, carbon taxes, public power, \"\"Community Choice,\"\" and production credits - all based on recent U.S. and European experience - are critically examined and recommendations made for changing course. At present, during this highly fluid period of utility restructuring, and absent more forceful regulation and demand management, it is dubious whether U.S. electricity market reform can encourage sufficient conversion to renewable energy to stem a rising tide of greenhouse gas emissions. \\xc2\\xa9 2004 by Association of American Geographers.\"\\n\"Ivanovich M.G.\",\"It\\'s Not Easy Being LEED\",2004,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1242331992&partnerID=40&md5=f959cab8b83410811bd6e340a26746e8\",\"U.S. Green Building Council\\'s (USGBC) rating system for new construction and extensive renovations (LEED) and ozone credit policy is discussed.

To achieve the target, several support programs, such as subsidization to capital cost, Green Credit by the Green Power Certification System, buy-back under the Renewable Portfolio Standard low, have been already introduced. Carbon tax is still under consideration, but there are several analyses about possible carbon tax. The purpose of this paper is to analyze PV system sales price and subsidy through buy-back which make photovoltaics cost-competitive with other energy technologies and make the target for PV capacity achievable by 2030 in Japan under an expected carbon tax. For the analysis energy system of Japan is modeled by using MARKAL. Based on the results of analysis, under 6000 JPY/t-C carbon tax, photovoltaics needs subsidy for a while even if we taking both fuel savings and Green Credit into account. For attaining the national target for PV capacity in 2010, photovoltaics needs more expensive buy-back than that in present, but after 2010 necessary buy-back decreases gradually. If 120 JPY/W PV system sales price is attained by 2030, photovoltaics becomes cost-competitive without any supports. Subsidy through buy-back becomes almost unnecessary in 2030, if we can reduce it less than 170 JPY/W. The total necessary buy-back meets peak in 2025. It is much more than ongoing subsidy to capital cost of PV systems, but annual revenue from the assumed carbon tax can finance the annual total necessary buy-back. This means if photovoltaics can attain the targeted PV system sales price, we should support it for a while by spending carbon tax revenue effectively and efficiently. \\xc2\\xa9 2004, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

INTRODUCTION In 2003, the stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Czech Republic reached about USD 40 billion, which is the highest FDI stock per capita in Central and Eastern Europe. Whereas the world economy and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) countries including Hungary and Poland experienced a decline in FDI inflows, FDI flows to the Czech Republic in fact accelerated in recent years2 - not least because of the special efforts the Czech government has made since 1998 to attract strategic foreign investors during the privatization of large banks and utilities as well as through incentives for green-field development. Against this background, an issue of current interest is whether FDI actually enhances welfare, which basically depends on how FDI enterprises perform and how they are distributed among sectors. Traditional trade theory analyses FDI as capital imports. Yet the modern theory of industrial organization assumes that firms which have the resources to operate internationally possess certain assets (technology, managerial skills, access to credit) that give them technical and organizational advantages over domestic firms. Therefore foreign firms might have other characteristics than domestic firms, and FDI might have additional effects beyond the mere import of capital (Caves 1996). So far empirical studies examining the performance of foreign-owned enterprises (FEs) have been inconclusive. Studies have found FEs to perform better than domestic ones and vice versa (Pfaffermayer and Bellak 2002, p. 13).

Under farm forestry the industry is promoting planting activity at an average rate of 40,000 ha/annum. The carbon sequestration potential of these plantations work out to 2.0 million tonnes resulting in CO2 mitigation of 7.2 million tonnes with an approximate carbon credit value of US $ 6.0 million (Rs. 30 crores). These plantations, apart from serving as effective carbon sinks, also provide several other environmental benefits such as conservation of natural forests and biodiversity, prevention of soil and water erosion, increasing the green cover and improving the socio economic conditions of rural poor. There are very few cases of carbon mitigation projects throughout the world under forestry. If industrial plantations are to be considered under CDM through carbon sequestration, issues like baseline, estimation, measurements, leakages, additionality, monitoring, evaluation, reporting, verification, certification and cost of MERVC is to be addressed as this is an entirely new activity for India.\"\\n\"Sissell K.\",\"Dow to use landfill methane for power generation\",2003,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-23044432621&partnerID=40&md5=8a57a983266240fa443e3f1e3f6fd4ac\",\"Dow Chemical has joined the Green Market Development Group, a coalition of companies and the World Resources Institute.

The application of DOR technologies on motor vehicles allows an automaker to receive non-methane organic gas (NMOG) emission credits, which may be applied to offset vehicle tailpipe emissions or evaporative emissions from fuel tanks. Additionally, DOR technologies can enhance the \"\"green image\"\" of an automaker. DOR devices involve catalyst coatings on radiators or other surfaces in such a way that the amount of ozone in the ambient air passing through such surfaces is reduced. The deposition of catalysts onto substrates (e.g. radiator surfaces) is traditionally accomplished using a slurry process, which often involves multiple steps in coating formation. In this work, deposition of catalytic coatings onto radiator surfaces via kinetic and thermal spray processes is explored. We demonstrate that catalytic materials could be successfully deposited directly onto radiator surfaces using a thermal spray process. Coating characterization studies show that the composition of catalytically active coating surfaces is MnOx (x between 1.5 to 2) when metal Mn powders are used as a feedstock. Our results show that ozone removal by the thermally sprayed Mn-based catalysts on radiators is efficient (about 70-80% at the radiator\\'s fully warmed-up temperature of about 82 \\xc2\\xb0C) and is comparable to or better than commercially available sample catalysts prepared using slurry-based deposition techniques. The thermal spray process is relatively rapid, involves only a single step in coating formation, and potentially is a low cost alternative to the current slurry technology.

To secure economic efficiency and control of carbon credits price, it is essential for the Japanese government that it quickly establishes a transparent and economically-efficient system for the four credit mechanisms: Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), Joint Implementation (JI), excess emission allowance (hot air) trade with Russia, and domestic greenhouse gas emission reduction project (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cunilateral JI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) in Japan with a special budget (carbon account) for credit purchase which is additional to current ODA flow to comply with the requirement of the Kyoto protocol.

Electric utility companies have the options of reducing their use of fossil fuels, switching to alternative energy sources, increasing efficiency, or offsetting carbon emissions. This study determined the cost and profitability of sequestering carbon in green ash plantations, and the number of tons of carbon that can be sequestered. The profitability of green ash is 2,342 dollars and 3,645 dollars per acre on site indices (measurement of soil quality) 65 and 105 land, respectively, calculated with a 2.5% alternative rate of return (ARR). These figures shift to -248 dollars and -240 dollars calculated with a 15.0% ARR. If landowners who have an ARR of 2.5% can sell carbon credits for 10 dollars per ton of carbon, profits will increase by 107 dollars per acre on poor sites and 242 dollars on good sites. Over one rotation (cutting cycle), 38.56 net tons of carbon can be sequestered on an acre of poor quality land and 51.35 tons on good quality land. The cost of sequestering carbon, without including revenues from timber production and carbon credits, ranges from a high of 15.20 dollars per ton on poor sites to 14.41 dollars on good sites, calculated with a 2.5% ARR; to a high of 8.51 dollars per ton on poor sites to 7.63 dollars on good sites, calculated with a 15.0% ARR.

Instead, wood, and biomass generally, including waste biomass, may be used to make methanol, which is the simplest alcohol and the ideal clean-burning liquid fuel. This offers a cleaner and more efficient way to use biomass as the primary source for household energy wherever adequate quantities of biomass can be grown on a sustainable basis. This opportunity exists because there is a proven stove that operates safely and effectively with methanol - the Dometic Origo\\xc2\\xae stove. Currently used in special applications where safety and air quality are all-important, this stove is being adapted for use in developing countries. The Dometic Corporation is building a sturdy, functional and inexpensive stove for use in the simplest household.

The authors discuss technologies available to gasify biomass for methanol synthesis and, likewise, a technology to manufacture methanol from synthesis gas on a small scale. The authors argue that methanol from natural gas is the ideal bridge between the current day and the day when biomass can be manufactured from plantation and renewably harvested biomass on a scale large enough to achieve economies and serve significant populations. This is referred to as the \"\"hard green\"\" approach, in contrast to the \"\"soft green\"\" approach that seeks to find more efficient ways to continue to burn wood directly. The opportunities for developing countries that implement a methanol-based energy economy are discussed. Introduction of the stove and its fuel would result in savings per family of 5 tonnes of CO2 per year. If carbon credits are sold, this could return money to the family to offset the cost of stove and fuel. Labour savings from not having to gather fuel-wood could mean additional hours each day for gainful employment. Local manufacture and distribution of the stove and fuel represent potential wealth-producing industries. The authors note that the use of methanol will not be limited to cooking. Other appliances are under development for refrigeration and lighting. Engines and small direct methanol fuel cells will generate household electricity. Because of the close link between household energy and local enterprise, the availability of adequate energy supplies and the technology to use them will create the opportunity for many wealth-producing activities. \\xc2\\xa9 2002 International Energy Initiative, Inc.\"\\n\"Arnold D.\",\"Natural ventilation in a large mixed mode building\",2002,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0344108234&doi=10.4324%2f9780203476659&partnerID=40&md5=2b21036599081e3b31e5787cd3403d67\",\"A large credit company has decided to relocate and centralise its offices and operations from a number of city centre sites in Northampton to the outskirts on a \\xe2\\x80\\x98green\\xe2\\x80\\x99 field site. Their present buildings are air conditioned but, the concept for the new building is an \\xe2\\x80\\x98environmentally friendly\\xe2\\x80\\x99, natural ventilated, low rise, one with a street style atrium. Only a small area of the building requires air conditioning for operational reasons. At an early stage of the conceptual design the client expressed certain concerns over whether natural ventilation would be adequate to maintain comfort in view of the extent to which the company relies on computers and associated peripheral equipment. The heat released from equipment in typical areas of their existing offices was surveyed and used as parameters in thermal models. Initial temperature predictions indicated that on the basis of natural ventilation alone internal temperatures would only exceed 26\\xc2\\xb0C in the afternoons of a few days in a typical year. However, the client decided that the internal temperature should be limited to a maximum of 25\\xc2\\xb0C during the warmest days of a typical summer. Intentionally providing a margin for exceptional summers and the risk of climate change. The client also required the option to install full air conditioning at some future time for investment purposes. Comparisons were made between full air conditioning, various mixed mode strategies. The design solution is a mixed mode building comprising both natural and mechanical systems that will operate predominantly in the natural mode. Natural ventilation is provided by fixed open trickle ventilators, opening windows, and automatically controlled vertical open lights in the atrium roof and side wall glazing. The mechanical systems include forced ventilation (displacement) and direct cooling (chilled beams), only intended for use when natural systems are inadequate. The paper is a design case study that describes the philosophy behind the design and, the analyses and modelling techniques used to determine the provision for natural ventilation. \\xc2\\xa9 1997 E & FN spon.\"\\n\"Hoffner J., Cowell S., Pichumani J., Porrazzo D., Wiese S., Wylde J.\",\"Sun power electric - A solar utility\",2002,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036956868&partnerID=40&md5=d43c48e8b0355eb76a1b13356d6b1b6f\",\"Sun Power Electric is the first all-solar electric utility formed to sell electricity to commercial customers (hosts) and renewable energy credits (RECs) to retailers of green power and \"\"green tags\"\" in deregulated utility markets.

In 1999-2000, the most \"\"green\"\" motor fuel was confronted with skepticism with respect to its safety, the improvement of the taxation on other motor fuels, the evolution of the regulations, and the necessary adaptation to the supply of the manufacturers. The consumption of LPG motor fuel in France slowed in 2000 with a 7% market growth and a significant drop in registrations (9,400 new vehicles in the last 12 months versus 19,500 in 1999). At the start of 1999 a LPG motor fuel vehicle exploded that led the authorities to make it mandatory to adopt a safety valve for all LPG motor fuel vehicles as of December 31, 2001. This measure suppresses the risk of explosion. Although LPG motor fuel does not contain lead, benzene, and sulfur, and does not emit particles, LPG motor fuel risks being affected by the hardening of European legislation on polluting emissions, imposing new constraints to the automobile industry. Vehicles will be subject to new sanctions tied to the Euro 3 standards that involves control of the emissions of vehicles as they leave the manufacturing plant and also at 80,000 km. This imposes more sophisticated LPG equipment in engine management such as systems of multi-point gas injection.\"\\n\"Morthorst P.E.\",\"Interactions of a tradable green certificate market witha tradable permits market\",2001,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034745367&doi=10.1016%2fS0301-4215%2800%2900133-6&partnerID=40&md5=d46ed2b66596cb679e9e5646eb40a550\",\"The reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is an important goal in the energy and environmental policies of the European Union (EU) and its member states. According to a recent directive-proposal from the EU-commission, the inclusion of renewable technologies is one of the important ways to achieve this emission reduction. More policy instruments are on hand to pursue this objective. Frequently discussed currently is the establishing of a market for tradable permits for CO2-emissions to achieve emission reductions in the power industry. In parallel with this is the introduction of a green certificate market to promote the development of renewables. If these two instruments are brought into play at the same time, two separate markets with two individual targets will co-exist in a number of countries. With a focus on the green certificate market, this paper discusses how these two markets may interact with each other in international trade. Three different cases are analysed: (1) A green certificate market without any tradable permits scheme, (2) a green certificate market in combination with a tradable permits scheme, based on grandfathering and, finally, (3) a green certificate market in combination with a tradable permits bidding scheme. Emphasis is placed on analysing the pricing mechanisms in international trade at the green certificate and tradable permits market in relation to the value of the reductions in GHG-emissions actually achieved. The influence of the permits scheme on the spot market price of electricity is shown, and the benefits of trading green certificates compared to a domestic implementation of renewable technologies are discussed. The main conclusion is that only if a green certificate market is combined with a tradable permit scheme based on a bidding procedure will trade in certificates be equivalent to the domestic development of renewables. Using the bidding system no other country will have to pay for CO2-reductions in the home country of the renewable development, as would otherwise be the case if a tradable permit system based on grandfathering were introduced or - even worse - if no tradable permits were introduced at all. Finally, it must be stated that even if the green certificate market were introduced alongside with a tradable permit bidding system, there still would be no incentives for international certificate trade on account of the need for GHG-reductions. In the version of the green certificate market discussed in this paper no GHG-credits are attached to certificates. This means that the development of renewables will add to GHG-reductions only in those countries, where the plants are established, no matter what kind of tradable permit scheme is adopted. \\xc2\\xa9 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To address this challenge major industrialized countries have signed onto the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In response leading companies around the world are now investigating opportunities and evaluating the risks associated with their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Creating a successful market for GHG credits will depend, in large part, on the development of credible measurement and verification protocols. Decision-makers need to be assured that an improvement option undertaken in a manufacturing plant does not result in upstream or downstream changes that will increase the overall release of GHGs. In this paper we argue that by using a systems analysis approach companies can have a broader perspective that will enable to not only measure their GHG baselines but also identify reduction opportunities and evaluate trade-offs. In addition, the approach fits into an environmental management system framework and is based on internationally accepted standards. A case example will be used to demonstrate this approach and to show the short and long term benefits of such a perspective.

Green, Soo Yeon Kim, and David H. Yoon argue that many findings in quantitative international relations that use the dyad-year design are flawed. In particular, they argue that the effect of democracy on both trade and conflict has been vastly overstated, that researchers have ignored unobserved heterogeneity between the various dyads, and that heterogeneity can be best modeled by \"\"fixed effects,\"\" that is, a model that includes a separate dummy for each dyad. We argue that the use of fixed effects is almost always a bad idea for dyad-year data with a binary dependent variable like conflict. This is because conflict is a rare event, and the inclusion of fixed effects requires us to not analyze dyads that never conflict. Thus while the 90 percent of dyads that never conflict are more likely to be democratic, the use of fixed effects gives democracy no credit for the lack of conflict in these dyads. Green, Kim, and Yoon\\'s fixed-effects logit can tell us little, if anything, about the pacific effects of democracy. Their analysis of the impact of democracy on trade is also flawed. The inclusion of fixed effects almost always masks the impact of slowly changing independent variables; the democracy score is such a variable. Thus it is no surprise that the inclusion of dyadic dummy variables in their model completely masks the relationship between democracy and trade. We show that their preferred fixed-effects specification does not outperform a model with no effects (when that model is correctly specified in other ways). Thus there is no need to include the masking fixed effects, and so Green, Kim, and Yoon\\'s findings do not overturn previous work that found that democracy enhanced trade. We agree with Green, Kim, and Yoon that modeling heterogeneity in time-series cross-section data is important. We mention a number of alternatives to their fixed-effects approach, none of which would have the pernicious consequences of using dyadic dummies in their two reanalyses. \\xc2\\xa9 2001 by The IO Foundation and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\"\\n\"Onyejekwe C.J.\",\"Micro-finance and Economic Empowerment: Women\\'s Cooperatives in Nigeria\",2001,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035566267&doi=10.1080%2f12259276.2001.11665915&partnerID=40&md5=4239ee020964eba6888c0b490992e710\",\"This paper discusses how the capacity of micro-credit interventions in Nigeria were made more effective when combined with other development activities, especially participation through women\\'s associations.

Environment Minister Michael Meacher MP officially launched it on 25 May. Much of the final strategy is built on drafts and consultation documents that have been circulated over the last two years, and the strategy looks at the stages required to move towards a more sustainable waste management system and to meet the requirements of the EU Landfill Directive. But just what does it say and more importantly what does it mean for the management of waste? The key policy and practical issues are presented here, along with an interpretation of how they will alter the management of waste in England and Wales. Tough statutory targets for recycling; developing new markets for recycled waste; turning public sector purchasing green; giving more producers responsibility for recycling of used products; and enlisting householders in the drive to recycle and compost more waste. These moves are key to tackling our growing waste mountain\\', Environment Minister Michael Meacher said as he published the Waste Strategy for England and Wales. He also pledged that the public sector\\'s requirement to buy \\'recycled\\' will help increase the demand and stabilize the markets for recycling schemes, whilst the strategy also acknowledges the need for waste minimization to counter the trend of 3% per annum municipal waste growth, with emphasis on \\'breaking the link that exists between economic growth and increased waste production\\'. Key measures in the Waste Strategy include:. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 new plans to require Government departments to buy recycled products, starting with paper;. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 statutory local authority recycling targets and action plans;. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 more use of the landfill tax credit scheme to deliver an increase in recycling, particularly of household waste;. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 the new Waste and Resources Action Programme dedicated to developing new markets for recycled waste;. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 tradable permits limiting the amount of waste local authorities can send to landfill sites;. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 extending producers\\' responsibility to recover their products, for example newspapers, and junk mail;. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 continuing to raise public awareness, working with the National Waste Awareness Initiative. The central policy issues of the new Waste Strategy for England and Wales were \\'mandatory\\' recycling and recovery targets for local authorities (which would double recycling rates in only three years) and confirmation that tradable permits would be the route used for diverting biodegradable municipal waste from landfill in accordance with the EU Landfill Directive. This will allow authorities to decide whether to landfill additional waste above their quota (by buying permits from another authority) or to invest in alternative means of waste treatment and disposal. The Welsh Assembly is yet to agree on their mechanism. Other themes raised in the document include; action to curb junk-mail through producer responsibility initiatives, the piloting of green procurement projects within the government, a focus on metal wastes, action towards developing composting and markets for compost, and the achievement of an agreement for higher targets to be set for the recycled content of newsprint (up to 70%).\"\\n\"Becker J.\",\"Can sustainable agriculture/habitat management pay off?\",2000,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034472717&doi=10.1300%2fJ064v17n01_09&partnerID=40&md5=5fdcb2e189308e27239d8dc8f8a6667b\",\"Agricultural production in the US and the EC has expanded so successfully over the last 40 years that both governments are now seeking ways to limit it and the resulting environmental costs.

The mechanism, that is not yet in place, is meant to ease the implication of developing countries in the climate change struggle and at the same time provide the industrialized countries with a margin of flexibility in fulfilling their reduction commitments. The idea is that an industrialized country realizes a project reducing green house gas emissions in a developing country, and uses the resulting reductions to fulfil a part of its own quota. Cooperative procurement programs for increased end-use energy efficiency are one of the project categories that will possibly be eligible since they meet the double objective of the mechanism: to benefit simultaneously the environment and the development of the host country. The paper presents a theoretical framework to study the impact of the CDM on procurement programs and seeks to answer the question under which circumstances the mechanism will incite industrialized countries to invest in such projects. The conclusions are based on a numeric sensitivity analysis studying the impact of changes in the design of the mechanism, the level of remuneration of emission reduction credits, and the national and international energy policies. Projects carried out in Brazil are used as an illustration. Comparisons between the incentives for the implicated actors to invest in energy production and end-use efficiency projects are made. Lastly, an optimal design of the mechanism in order to make market transformation projects more attractive is proposed.\"\\n\"Hagemann R.\",\"Erwin Baur or Carl Correns: Who really created the theory of plastid inheritance?\",2000,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034477532&doi=10.1093%2fjhered%2f91.6.435&partnerID=40&md5=819cf580d1181816a3302e0e96ef5189\",\"Historical reviews of the field of non-Mendelian genetics and many other publications credit Erwin Baur and Carl Correns equally for the development of the theory of plastid inheritance. However, a study of the original literature indicates that this conclusion is not correct. Analysis of the relevant articles leads to the conclusion that Baur alone deserves credit for the theory of plastid inheritance, in his classic article on the inheritance properties of white-margined Pelargonium plants, Baur (1909) stated: (1) The plastids are carriers of hereditary factors which are able to mutate. (2) In variegated plants, random sorting-out of plastids is taking place. (3) The genetic results indicate a biparental inheritance of plastids by egg cells and sperm cells in Pelargonium. By contrast, Correns held the view that in variegated plants there is a maternally transmitted labile state of the cytoplasm which switches either to a permanently \"\"healthy\"\" state (allowing the \"\"indifferent\"\" plastids to become green chloroplasts) or to a permanently \"\"diseased, ill\"\" cytoplasmic state (causing white plastids and cells). Otto Renner supported Baur\\'s theory and worked out important characteristics of plastid inheritance in the genus Oenothera. In the 1930s Renner reported many more observations, which established plastid inheritance as a widely accepted genetic theory.\"\\n\"Morthorst P.E.\",\"Scenarios for the use of GHG-reduction instruments - how can policy-instruments as carbon emission trading and tradable green certificates be used simultaneously to reach a common GHG-reduction target?\",2000,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033741362&doi=10.1260%2f0958305001500220&partnerID=40&md5=b87515d2a8bfa818ce1408c79aeeeb95\",\"According to the agreed burden sharing in the EU, a number of member states have to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases substantially. To achieve these reductions various policy-instruments - national as well as international - are on hand. Two international instruments are emphasized in this paper: tradable quotas for limiting carbon emissions and tradable green certificates for promoting the deployment of renewable energy technologies. In the analyses of these two instruments two main questions are considered: 1) Will there be any international trade in green certificates, if no GHG-credits are attached to them? 2) Will it make any difference if the EU sets the targets to be achieved by the two instruments or alternatively the individual member countries do? An incentive-analysis in which four scenarios are set up and discussed is performed for the EU member states. The main conclusion is that if no GHG-credits are attached to the green certificates there seems to be limited or no incentives for a permanent international trade in certificates. On the other hand, if GHG-credits are attached to the certificates an efficient international trade will take place regardless of whether the EU or the member countries fix the quotas. Thus, the use of international instruments as tradable green certificates and tradable emissions permits will not lead to an optimal GHG-reduction strategy unless GHG-credits are attached to the certificates.\"\\n\"Arnold David\",\"Thermal storage case study: Combined building mass and cooling pond\",2000,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033719795&partnerID=40&md5=c9c81b01d576879af505d73c898147b1\",\"In 1994 a large U.K. credit card company decided to relocate and centralize its offices and operations from a number of city center sites to the outskirts on a green field site.

This paper analyses the employment effects of revenue-neutral green tax reforms by focusing on the revenue-recycling effect. Our model contains three features which are important when looking at the employment effects of green tax reforms. First, there is unemployment in equilibrium. Second, wages are determined endogenously. Third, various institutional arrangements for taxing unemployment benefits, for the price-indexation of unemployment benefits and the personal tax exemption are considered. It is shown that these institutional arrangements are crucial for the effectiveness of green tax reforms. A revenue-neutral green tax reform will boost employment if unemployment benefits are nominally fixed and taxed at a lower rate than labour income. Employment actually falls if unemployment benefits are price indexed and taxed at the same rate. A revenue-neutral green tax reform which increases the personal tax credit will never increase employment.\"\\n\"Hillocks R.J., Phiri N.A., Overfield D.\",\"Coffee pest and disease management options for smallholders in Malawi\",1999,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033119510&doi=10.1016%2fS0261-2194%2899%2900017-4&partnerID=40&md5=f4120759f8aa2f29dc666de8d6a3c7fe\",\"The main source of income for up to 9000 smallholders in northern Malawi is coffee, yields of which are affected by insect pests, namely white stem borer (Monochamus leuconotus) and green scale (Coccus alpinus), and diseases - coffee berry disease (Colletotrichum kahawae) and leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix). Economic liberalisation in Malawi has removed subsidies from inputs and without credit schemes from the Smallholder Coffee Authority the use of commercial pesticides and fertiliser on coffee by smallholders has declined. Smallholder coffee in Malawi has been of high quality and if this can be maintained, there is potential for increased productivity.

This additional information on actual rather than predicted performance provides a number of important lessons for the environmental assessment of buildings. Future expectations for the development of GBC from the UK perspective include providing proper credit for design features such as low-energy passive cooling and daylighting, modifying the assessment weighting system to provide more reliable comparison or benchmarking between design solutions, providing a practical international assessment method for comparison or benchmarking, incorporating post-occupancy evaluation to validate assessment methods and tools. Ease of use is important and GBC could usefully be simplified to consider the point of application in design, post-design certification and post-occupancy.

This study, and the interviews on which it is based, focus on the \\'opportunistic\\' method, whereby the fall in coffee prices in Cameroon eventually led to a change in resource allocation in favour of women. Coffee, the only cash crop of the North West Province of Cameroon, is mainly produced in the Santa area. As the main source of family income, coffee production is a male occupation. Women assist only in weeding, harvesting, and preparation for sales. Since men have authority over land, most family land is used for coffee cultivation. A woman can only acquire land for growing subsistence crops through endless pleading. When women depended solely on their husbands, talk of \\'demarginalization\\' (or empowerment) was viewed as day-dreaming, or just paranoia. But the fall in coffee prices in the early 1980s marked a turning point in the lives of Santa women. It has been argued that for women to benefit from the Green Revolution calls for new cultural norms that permit them the land-owning and other legal rights now denied them. Many African agricultural development programmes are based on land (see Getis, 1985), which women are excluded from owning-and Santa women were no different in this respect. Although in Cameroon, women are seen as good for producing household subsistence crops, decisions concerning the use of land remains with men; women would not even have access to land to produce enough food for their family. But if \\'every cloud has a silver lining\\', the fall in coffee prices helped to demarginalize the wome of Santa, through their own creative effort.This article discusses processes that demarginalize women in developing countries. The case study pertained to women in the Santa coffee growing area of North West Province, Cameroon. Coffee is the main source of income for families. Women obtain land for growing subsistence crops with the permission of their husbands and with pleading. The sharp fall in coffee prices left families in economic difficulties. It forced families to reduce coffee production or abandon coffee production entirely. Women found an alternative in growing vegetables for retail sale. The women formed associations that provided instruction on how to farm, sell produce, and obtain credit. Men observed the increase in income from the women\\'s sale of produce. Women included the men in discussions about their progress and difficulties. Men were thus encouraged to sell their land to women. Women gained power by becoming the sole source of family income. The women\\'s groups helped women improve land use and the use of income. This experience proved that crises can have positive outcomes. Men\\'s power was based on economic control over resources rather than culture or machismo. Women\\'s cooperation with men in nation building resulted in economic independence. Marginalization of women was based on money. Women proved that participation, rather than power, was the appropriate means to social change and more equitable relations. The obstacles to women\\'s power included cultural expectations about their roles and choices, sex discrimination, and lack of access to leadership networks.\"\\n\"White V.John\",\"Plug into clean power\",1998,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032116440&partnerID=40&md5=8cba458a7df8a60bb19933355e754168\",\"The Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (CEERT) is focused on exploiting clean power opportunities of the new, open market.

It is concluded that there is an important role that economic instruments can play in this policy area. The inherent efficiency gains that economic instruments may provide deserve to be highlighted. The application of such instruments in the current political economy settings will however serve to reduce such efficiency gains, as multiple and conflicting policy objectives are introduced by the political process. While there are instances where appropriately designed environmental taxes can provide an important element of environmental policy, there is a danger nevertheless that an ill-conceived comprehensive \\'environmental tax reform\\' could be detrimental.

The primary cause of this cataclysm is human destruction of natural ecosystems through consumption and pollution. Population growth and increased consumption rates will deepen mankind\\'s encroachment into species\\' natural habitats. Until this encroachment ceases and reverses, species near the brink of extinction cannot recover. By destroying natural habitats, humans are destroying the evolutionary theaters essential to species recovery and recreation. Humans have many different reasons for desiring preservation of nonhuman species. These include religious, ethical, and utilitarian reasons, some of which not only justify, but mandate, preserving the highest level of biological diversity. Therefore, a statutory regime directed toward species preservation also should attempt to save all species. The ESA is the United States\\' primary tool to combat species extinction. The ESA\\'s legislative history shows that, on passing the Act, Congress desired to save each and every species at any monetary cost. However, the current ESA is incapable of doing more than delaying the inevitable extinction of many species. Since passage of the ESA in 1973, only a small number of species have been recovered or downlisted. Of these recoveries and downlistings, the ESA can take direct credit for only a few. Most species have improved due to unrelated factors. There are numerous reasons why the ESA does not sufficiently protect species. As discussed in sections III(B) and VI(B), the ESA remains biologically and administratively inadequate. Additionally, the ESA has engendered conflicts between conservationists and certain landowners. Sections 7 and 9 of the ESA restrict certain land uses and allow little flexibility or economic activity. Under the ESA, private landowners cannot engage in economic activities that damage the species\\' habitat. In an effort to escape the ESA\\'s strictures, landowners either turn to the courts and federal legislature, or to clandestinely removing rare species and habitats from their lands. These landowners may be part of the wise-use movement, a politically powerful group that advocates weakening the ESA and other environmental laws. The bottom line is that the ESA does not adequately preserve species while alienating developers and industry groups. What is the solution? How can the U.S. preserve its biological diversity and make landowners happy? Congress should replace the current ESA with an ecosystem management system that provides economic incentives for private landowners. The goal of ecosystem management is to preserve the highest possible level of biological diversity. Because each ecosystem is unique, each is bestowed with its own number and types of species. Thus, the most practical way to save the remaining biological resources is to locate and manage ecosystems\\' unique attributes. Protection extends to include ecosystems that are the most endangered, support the greatest number of species, and are endowed with the most unusual flora and fauna that can support unique and highly adaptable species. Ecosystem boundaries must be based on ecological integrity and only after intensive studies. Also, green corridors or linkage zones must be protected because they link isolated habitats and populations of species together. Ecosystem management should be tiered in three levels to involve public and private lands. The first tier should include parcels of land designated as preserves and completely protected from all forms of significant human interference. The second tier should include parcels designated for partial development. The final tier should include lands that are convertible to human use, such as industrial sites and extractive reserves. Ecosystem management not only would protect species better, but also would lessen conflicts between conservationists andlandowners. This preservation scheme would provide more simple, reliable, and consistent rules with which developers and industry groupscould comply. It enables conservationists to identify potential problems early and engage in preventative measures.\"\\n\"Hastreiter Joe\",\"Green Bay snow removal includes assisting packers in playoffs\",1997,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031189657&partnerID=40&md5=b9b765bea5bfd5ae2a4936f85913c9d8\",\"With considerable credit to the city\\'s Public Works and its 296 employees, Green Bay successfully hosted the NFC championship game, presenting a favorable `city that works\\' image.

In traditional cropping systems, crop protection is based on a combination of techniques to constrain pest development: IPM \\'avant la lettre\\'. Resource-poor farmers are experimenters and inventors, who learn and generate their own technology. Their agricultural practices are often very well adapted to the agro-ecological and socio-economic conditions, and farming systems are flexible and responsive to all kinds ofrisks, including those ofpests. These low-externalinput systems often operate near the optimum, but generally do not produce high yields. To increase yields and reduce crop losses, agricultural development programmes have been launched. Subsidized pesticides were made easily available and have been a major factor in disrupting traditional pest management practices. The technology transfer model has been used, based on results of formal research which did not take very much into consideration the typical agro-ecological, human health, environmental and social aspects of low external input systems. A more integrated, site-specific approach to development is necessary to solve the many problems related to sustainability in agriculture. The original concept of IPM emerged in response to the negative consequences of chemical pest management in high external-input agriculture. However, for resource-poor farmers, IPM should be considered a methodology for arriving at appropriate pest management systems using participatory methods in problem definition and technology development. The informal research and development capacity in Africa should be the basis for a resource-poor farmer Green Revolution \\'from within\\'. This approach of stimulating the farmer to become an experimenter and a generator of technology goes against most of the current thinking on agricultural policy, research and extension, but it is in our opinion the only way to achieve the full potential of IPM in Africa. \\xc2\\xa9 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\"\\n\"McMaster G.S., Wilhelm W.W.\",\"Conservation compliance credit for winter wheat fall biomass production and implications for grain yield\",1997,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031421639&partnerID=40&md5=11a14f351de1636fc8314693ae61a016\",\"Producers participating in federal farm and conservation programs must reduce potenial erodibility below certain thresholds on lands classified as highly erodible.

The inherent efficiency gains that economic instruments will provide should be highlighted and advocated. The application of such instruments in the current political economy settings will however serve to reduce such efficiency gains, as multiple and conflicting policy objectives are introduced by the political process.\"\\n\"McBoyle G.\",\"Green tourism and Scottish distilleries\",1996,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030478426&doi=10.1016%2f0261-5177%2896%2900017-9&partnerID=40&md5=4ba7e9ac680e99d6162ce5c0736a180a\",\"This article examines the opportunities for a firm to enhance its environmental reputation by promoting its \\'green credits\\' to visiting tourists.

As the use of imported mineral fertilizers is beyond the economic means of resource-poor farmers, research and extension efforts of several projects, institutes and organizations concentrated during the last 15 years on the development and promotion of improved follows with woody and herbaceous legumes, like Tephrosia sp., Cajanus sp., Crotalaria sp., Sesbania sp., Mucuna sp. and Mimosa sp., planted over one or more seasons as pure green manure, in hedgerows (alley cropping), or on fields as seasonal inter- or relay-crop. Green manuring proved to be a risky enterprise, due to highly variable biomass production and residual effects. Yield increments on-farm of up to 74% in the first season and 46% in the second season did not compensate loss of yields and labour investments during green manuring. Even where biomass production was sufficient, residual effects were in most cases unsatisfactory, due to rapid nutrient leaching (N, K) or inappropriate foliage incorporation on-farm. In researcher-managed trials, residual effects were in general somewhat higher, but more than a mere compensation of lost yields was not possible and farmers\\' adoption of these labour- intensive technologies was rather low. Due to acute land shortage, farmers were reluctant in allocating land to follows or hedgerows also, with the exception of fields already out of production. Consequently, the concept of improving soil fertility and crop yields with the help of planted follows or green manure in rotation failed. Woody legumes might have a future on abandoned fields and in wide spaced contour hedges, mainly for the production of firewood and bean stakes. For soil fertility management, the production and availability of farmyard manure and country own mineral fertilizers, such as travertin and volcanic ashes should be supported. The question is raised as to whether sustainable agricultural development is possible without a credit system for small farmers, reallocating land and creating off-farm employment.\"\\n\"Eicher C.K.\",\"Zimbabwe\\'s maize-based Green Revolution: Preconditions for replication\",1995,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029511760&doi=10.1016%2f0305-750X%2895%2993983-R&partnerID=40&md5=bc5aa5c3bb166ba5a5df8ed9a0f9c98b\",\"The Green Revolution was launched in 1960 in Zimbabwe, five years before it got underway in India. Since Zimbabwe\\'s Green Revolution was spearheaded by white commercial farmers, however, it was ignored by Africa\\'s new leaders in the 1960s as they experimented with state farms from Moscow, communal farms from China and land settlement schemes from Israel. At Zimbabwe\\'s independence in 1980, the new majority-ruled government introduced a number of programs to help smallholders increase food and cash crop production. Drawing on a backlog of hybrid maize varieties, expanded access to credit, higher guaranteed government maize prices, and marketing subsidies, smallholders doubled maize production during 1980-1986. Zimbabwe\\'s maize-based Green Revolution challenges those who allege that hybrid maize cannot compete with sorghum in low rainfall areas and that it is unsuitable for resource-poor farmers because of the need to purchase new seed each year. Today virtually 100% of Zimbabwe\\'s maize area is under hybrids and short-season hybrids are outcompeting other foodgrains in many low rainfall areas. Zimbabwe\\'s biggest challenge is to develop cost-effective marketing policies and institutions to sustain its maize-based Green Revolution. Countries trying to replicate Zimbabwe\\'s success story should focus on fulfilling four interrelated preconditions: political, technological, economic and institutional. \\xc2\\xa9 1995.\"\\n\"Mahmood M.\",\"Growth and distribution of agrarian assets in the Punjab\",1995,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029429132&doi=10.30541%2fv34i3pp.181-223&partnerID=40&md5=d4a57477b7bd2b43b16b6d46a80c42e7\",\"This is a micro study of the growth and distribution of the non-land agrarian assets in the Punjab between 1970 and 1984. To examine asset accumulation, the authors posit an analytical framework of exogenous and endogenous constraints on growth, which is useful in picking up both the common and contrasting patterns of growth and distribution across the two distinct regions of the Punjab, the canal colonies, and southern Punjab. The first exogenous constraint of an imperfect credit market is macro in nature, and is common to both regions, which strongly handicaps asset acquisition by small farmers. Further, there is edvidence that, given the new technology, the ownership of assets is an important determinant of both growth and distribution. So this initial equity bias against small farmers in the first round of accumulation implies an even greater bias in the second round. The second endogenous constraint is regionally specific to the more land-concentrated southern region, which generates supervision costs for the largest operators, preventing them from expanding their operated area further through increased mechanisation. It also adds to the persistence in southern Punjab of the contractual form of sharecropping.\"\\n\"Middleton Jr. George L., McBurney Christian M.\",\"New energy policy act\\'s \\xe2\\x80\\xb3green tax\\xe2\\x80\\xb3 package will benefit project finance\",1993,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027559080&partnerID=40&md5=60d508961d6da0bfdcdca283a337bf11\",\"The project finance industry will benefit from the recently enacted Energy Policy Act of 1992.

This research was based on the concept held by some that natural chemicals are better as a part of industrial ecology. The authors have attempted to define the foam manufacturing suitability of natural chemicals, but have not defined or defended the policy implications of such choices. Natural chemicals are often less suitable than those refined from petroleum and may then need some environmental credit related to greater discharge to be viable substitutes. Modest decreases in density (relative to foams without any auxiliary blowing agent) were obtained with the addition of solid CO2but other physical properties were not measured. It is unclear whether the reduction in density is a result of the phase change of CO, from solid to liquid within the polyurethane cell matrix or simply a bubbling effect of C02 in solution causing voids within the final product. Although it was anticipated that the high boiling point of limonene, from citrus peeis, would negate effectiveness as an auxiliary blowing agent, there were analogous decreases in foam density. The observed effect might be rationalized by the significant vapor pressure of limonene at temperatures lower than the boiling point. The limonene may be sweptf rom the foam system coincident with the loss of in situ generated CO2isoprene, naturally emitted from deciduous vegetation as well as from the combustion of carbonaceous fuels, provides a useful, if not complete, range of foam densities and may then be a partial substitute for halogenated auxiliary blowing agents. Switching from methyiene chloride to isoprene as the auxiliary blowing agent of choice would immediately decrease organic emissions from polyurethane foam plants by 20 percent (molecular weight effect). Regulation as a VOC and the residual acrid odor may be potential drawbacks to commercial utilization of isoprene. \\xc2\\xa9 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\"\\n\"Foster J.B.\",\"Britain\\'s Green Budget\",1992,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84958309883&doi=10.1080%2f10455759209358484&partnerID=40&md5=65720e8fcbec1e01fad8473e71fe0e17\",\"Edited by U.K. Green Party members David Kemball-Cook, Mallen Baker, and Chris Mattingly and endorsed for publication by the Green Party Council, The Green Budget: An Emergency Programme for the United Kingdom was published by Green Print, London, in 1991.

Hydrogen is to be produced via a photovoltaic-electrolysis system, utilizing the available non-agricultural sunny terrain in Baluchistan region. There will be a desalination plant for sea water desalination. The area under the photovoltaic panels with the availability of water would provide suitable environment for growing some cash crops. This would change the vast useless desert land into green productive farms. In order to show the quantitative benefits of the proposed system, future trends of important energy and economical parameters have been studied with and without hydrogen introduction. These included population, energy demand (fossil + hydrogen), energy production (fossil + hydrogen), gross national product, fossil energy imports, world energy prices, environmental savings due to hydrogen introduction, savings due to the higher utilization efficiency of hydrogen, by-product credit, agricultural income, income from hydrogen sale, photovoltaic cell area, total land area, water desalination plant capacity, capital investment, operating and maintenance cost, total income from the system environmental impact and quality of life. The results indicate that adopting the solar-hydrogen energy system would eliminate the import dependency on fossil fuels, increase gross product per capita, reduce pollution, improve quality of life, and establish a permanent and clean energy system. The total annual expenditure for the proposed system is quite small compared to the total income expected. The availability of water, the cast crop production, electricity and hydrogen would result in rapid development of Baluchistan, the largest province of Pakistan. \\xc2\\xa9 1991.\"\\n\"Wyman C.E., Hinman N.D.\",\"Ethanol - Fundamentals of production from renewable feedstocks and use as a transportation fuel\",1990,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025168105&doi=10.1007%2fBF02920291&partnerID=40&md5=a2386b2f555259f8262c5abdb936573f\",\"Ethanol can be directly blended with gasoline, reacted with isobutylene to form the oxygenated fuel additive ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), or burned directly as a neat fuel. Blends of either ethanol or ETBE with gasoline force engines set for gasoline to run lean and can substantially reduce carbon monoxide emissions. ETBE also lowers the overall vapor pressure, thereby cutting back on smog-forming emissions. Neat ethanol further reduces smog formation since it has a low volatility, the photochemical reactivity of ethanol and its combustion products is low, and low levels of smog producing compounds are formed by ethanol combustion. Neat ethanol also offers good engine performance owing to its high heat of vaporization, high octane, and low flame temperature. Fermentation stoichiometry reveals that many feedstocks are expensive for fuels production even considering coproduct credits and ignoring conversion costs, whereas lignocellulosic feedstocks cost much less than their value. Furthermore, the quantities of lignocellulosics are projected to be ample even for neat ethanol production. Release of carbon dioxide during fermentation concentrates almost all the heat of combustion from the solid carbohydrate portion in liquid ethanol. Since the carbon dioxide released during production and use of ethanol is recycled during growth of biomass, ethanol utilization doesn\\'t contribute to the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and possible global warming. \\xc2\\xa9 1990 Humana Press Inc.\"\\n\"Harrison P.\",\"Sustainable growth in African agriculture\",1990,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025621376&partnerID=40&md5=b2bca811b70194c8f3b18e8cea76cb97\",\"Provides an overview of the challenges facing sub-Saharan African agriculture in its attempts to achieve sustainable growth, first considering sources of output growth, limits of carrying capacity, and the process of adjustment.

For financing the use of agricultural technology, governments establish legally organized credit institutions which frequently offer subsidized credits. Such credits are made available under the existing societal modes of distribution, which leads to the domination of scarce resources by the elite in the rural regions, and, thus, to restriction in the access to credit for the rural sub-classes. Should small farmers or tenants, etc. wish to benefit from the advantages of modern agricultural technology, they have to depend on the informal credit market as a means of financing. By taking Pakistan as an example, the importance of the informal credit market for financing the use of modern technology from the period of the \\'Green Revolution\\' until the present can be shown. This informal credit market has contributed to keep tendencies towards social polarization in the agricultural sector within limits, since an informal credit system that was not efficient would have made it difficult for small farmers to use the productivity potentials of modern agricultural technology and would have caused social differences to expand. The informal credit market should be reinforced as a political measure for reducing tendencies towards social polarization. This should occur at least until the formal credit institutions actually assume their intended function for all rural groups. \\xc2\\xa9 1990.\"\\n\"Klein D.\",\"Development of genetic research in ophthalmology with special reference to Switzerland [DIE ENTWICKLUNG DER GENETISCHEN FORSCHUNG IN DER AUGENHEILKUNDE UNTER BESONDERER BERUCKSICHTIGUNG DER SCHWEIZ]\",1990,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025302426&doi=10.1055%2fs-2008-1046166&partnerID=40&md5=c2930a19a30d45c97e5971eab0473714\",\"The relationship between ophthalmology and genetics has always been a very active one, and existed even before Mendel\\'s laws of inheritance were known.

Franceschetti\\'s achievements include the description of several clinical syndromes, of which mandibulofacial dysostosis has become well known. Among the hereditary retinal dystrophies, he described fundus flavimaculatus (yellowish lesions disseminated in the deeper layers of the posterior pole) as a new entity, attributed to degeneration of the pigment epithelium. In addition to more than 500 articles, he was also co-author, with J. Francois and J.

Another monograph, Genetics and Ophthalmology, was written with P. J. Waardenburg and D. Klein (1961).

There is now significant evidence of the introduction and adoption of higher yielding varieties of maize, wheat and rice in Africa, as well as the adoption of other technological innovations in irrigation and mechanisation, albeit with widely varying degrees of success and with many instances of failure. It is noted that there are many standard technical explanations associated with the adoption of new technologies in agriculture, in particular, low levels of credit, poor supply of inputs, inadequate, faulty or no irrigation, poor extension advice, and low producer prices, as well as the poor state of the relationship between agronomic research and farm level innovation. However, the evidence so far collected for Africa suggests that a substantial part of the explanation of whether adoption of innovations takes place or not, and of their degree of success, is the nature of the social relations of production, relations not simply of class or strata, but also of gender. The major technical constraint on successful innovation adoption as revealed by most, if not all, of the studies surveyed turns out to be that of labour supply. The extent to which that constraint can be resolved turns not on increasing family labour supply, which often means increasing the intensity of female labour, but in hiring labour. The very hiring of labour presupposes the existence of a social formation in which free wage labour exists, or in which it can be created. Its creation will depend on the degree to which those interests which seek to accumulate through agricultural innovation have power and can exercise that power through the State. The first section of this article is an overview of various issues of theory and evidence involved in surveying the green revolution in Africa. The second section surveys the introduction of these new technologies into Africa and the final section draws some conclusions for policy and further analysis. \\xc2\\xa9 1988, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This paper attempts to shed light on the basic nature and pattern of this agrarian change as well as to discuss its implications. Accordingly, attention is given to the basic components of current technological innovation, namely, seeds, inputs, and credit. The patterns of agrarian change identified in this study are: firstly, the specialization of seed production, in other words, the alienation of farmers from seed production; secondly, the growing dependence of farmers on modern inputs; and, thirdly, the great expansion of the farm credit system in the rural community. It should be emphasized that, contrary to the frequent claims of the development economists, the tremendous expansion of the domestic market for farm inputs failed to encourage the growth of domestic agro-industries. Instead, au enormous impact was observed only in the marketing and financing sectors. This brought about the emergence of a commercial elite class in the rural community. Another point is that the massive diffusion of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreen revolution\\xe2\\x80\\x9d technology in the 1970s brought the country to self-sufficiency in rice. This resulted, on the one hand, in termination of rice imports from neighboring countries, but, on the other, it created a new dependence on the foreign capital necessary to acquire modern inputs. \\xc2\\xa9 1987, The Association of Japanese Geographers.

The very high cost of capital and of capital equipment renders the construction of new green field site plants, exemplifying the best available technology economically unattractive. For this reason, over the long term the development radically innovative steelmaking technologies appears to be the only satisfactory resolution of this dilemma. The purpose of this article is to present a critical review of some of the radically innovative steelmaking technologies that have been proposed during the past few years and to develop the argument that these indeed do deserve serious consideration at the present time. It should be stressed, however, that these innovative technologies can be implemented only as part of a carefully conceived long range plan, which contains as a subset short term solutions, such as trigger prices improved investment credits, and so forth and intermediate term solutions, such as more extensive use of continuous casting, external desulfurization and selective modernization in general. \\xc2\\xa9 1980 American Society for Metals and the Metallurgical Society of AIME.\"\\n\"Nielsen C.J., Kirkpatrick M.\",\"\"\"Little green slips\"\" make for better collections.\",1978,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0018010612&partnerID=40&md5=c851e266d32a65ed05d3fbde115036da\",[No abstract available]\\n\"Feder E.\",\"The New World Bank Programme for the Self-Liquidation of the Third World Peasantry\",1976,\"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84972860657&doi=10.1080%2f03066157608437986&partnerID=40&md5=92b052433a86578107951ff479543456\",\"For many years, the World Bank, whose task is to expand and strengthen the private enterprise system throughout the world, financed agricultural development projects whose beneficiaries were almost exclusively the landed oligarchy in the underdeveloped countries and, directly or indirectly, the multinational concerns. Many of the Bank\\'s loans helped to finance the modernization of the large estates and progressively weakened thereby the status of the underdeveloped countries\\xe2\\x80\\x99 peasants. Recently, in what at first sight might appear to be an about-face in its strategy, the Bank added a credit scheme to help ioo million smallholders. Upon closer analysis of this scheme and how it would operate within the framework of underdeveloped agricultures, it is found that it is in reality the most antisocial programme yet to be invented by this so-called development agency. It is bound to have such catastrophic consequences for the peasantry that it will make the \\xe2\\x80\\x98green revolution\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and similar modernization programmes look like child\\'s play, although it guarantees significant additional sales and profits for the multinational concerns. \\xc2\\xa9 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Even vegetables produced at a long-distance are also provided for the supply of cities (city dwellers). During the winter season, above all, venyle-house stands side by side at the warmer villages along the Pacific coast than Tokyo and Osaka, and there lots of greens are prepared for by means of the forcing culture. As a representative of these districts, the author has investigated Kochi prefecture and the facts obtained are as follows: 1) In Kochi prefecture, forcing culture of vegitables begins in the 1920\\'s, this is a producing area of an early truck-farming in Japan. A mild winter and the long sunshine mainly brought production of forcing-vegetables on a largescale. Another different ground of this prosperity is better service at the window (route): Products and their producers in Kochi prefecture banded together to make selling to each big city. Vegetables appended on the trade-mark label of Kochi have got the credit of the market-places, by supplying of constant large quantity of greens for the marketing. 2) Though forcing vegetables can maintain business relation with high price in each market, all the same, net profit per farm-house is not so much. Because it took farmer much time and cost him a great deal of money for production facilities to continue the work. In Kochi prefecture, recompense per hour of farmers is equivalent to 49% (in case of cucumber culture) as compared with the income of farmers in the suburban districts of Osaka city. It showed that, that is to say, they sell their labour cheaper than farmers close to cities. 3) At the village of T\\xc5\\x8d-no-Hama in Yasuda-cho situated near the Cape Muroto, according to the author\\'s searching inquiry, the farmers\\' average acreage under cultivation is 0.7 hectare. In summer they try to cultivate paddy rice and grow greens in winter in the same cultivated field. The earnest farmers to raise vegetables have 0.7-1.0 hectare area of plowed land for their cultivation. Compared with the farmers owning 1.0-1.4 hectare area, they have unfavorable conditions with their land under cultivation: this arable land is at a long distance from their residence, more humid, and lower temperature in winter than land owned belonging to a large-scale farmer. Notwithstanding the disadvantageous condition for growing vegetables, they carry on cultivating greens with the bigger extent under crop area than the other classes of farmers. Curiously enough, farmers having over 1.0 hectare held their cultivation of greens for fear of being cursed by soil fatigue. \\xc2\\xa9 1964, The Human Geographical Society of Japan.

Rooftop solar power plant (RTPV) is one of the good solar power generation technique. In this paper, a brief description on design, commissioning and techno economic analysis of a 50Kwp rooftop solar power plant design in Uluberia super specialty hospital Howrah, India have been described. The electricity generation in both input DC and output AC end of each inverter is recorded and monitored and analyzed in this paper. The input end DC power of the inverter is coming from solar panels. The open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Isc), maximum power (Mp) is noted as 48 V, 50 A, 49 KW, respectively, during 11am to 2 pm which is the bright sunny time of the day in West Bengal. The output power of the inverter is connected with the main transmission grid. The grid connectivity rule of solar power plant with main grid of West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (WBSEDCL) is briefly mentioned. The generated current, voltage, power by solar panels of the RTPV power plant is taken out using a remote data logger to a dedicated cloud server and analyzed the output data in this paper. The total load of the hospital building is 450 kva, which was paid earlier to WBSEDCL. The plant is generating an average of 5000 units per month, saving Rs. 511,817 per year. The Capacitive Utilization Factor (CUF) of this solar power plant is 14.7%. An attempt has been made to calculate the payback period or break-even years is approximately 5 years, Reduction of CO2 emission or carbon credit due to the plant has also been shown. A seasonal data analysis has been done to predict average output during any particular month of the year. Finally, it has been observed that this type of energy generation unit is suitable for all domestic as well as commercial applications for grid connected and off grid system with suitable battery backup in remote areas or sustainable and greener environment in the future. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\"\n"
